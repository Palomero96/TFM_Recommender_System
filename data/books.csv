62368338;eng;4.12;Champion. Survivor.Hero. Legend.Completed just two days before Louis Zamperini's death at age 97, Don't Give Up, Don't Give In shares a lifetime of wisdom, insight, and humor from one of America's most inspiring lives. Zamperini's story has touched millions through Laura Hillenbrand's biography Unbroken, soon to be a major motion picture directed by Angelina Jolie. Now, in his own words, Louis Zamperini reveals, with warmth and great charm, the essential values and lessons that sustained him throughout his remarkable journey.He was a youthful troublemaker from California who turned his life around to become a 1936 Olympian and a world,class miler at the University of Southern California. Putting aside his superstar track career, Louis Zamperini volunteered for the army before Pearl Harbor and was thrust into the violent combat of World War II as a B,24 bombardier. While on a rescue mission, his plane went down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where he survived, against all odds, drifting two thousand miles in a small raft for forty,seven days. His struggle was only beginning: Zamperini was captured by the Japanese and, for more than two years, he courageously endured torture and psychological abuse in a series of prisoner,of,war camps. He returned home to face more dark hours, but in 1949 Zamperini's life was transformed by a spiritual rebirth that would guide him through the next sixty,five years of his long and happy life.Cowritten with longtime collaborator David Rensin, Louis Zamperini's Don't Give Up, Don't Give In is an extraordinary last testament that captures the wisdom of a life lived to the fullest.A son of Italian immigrants, Louis Zamperini (1917,2014) was a U.S. Olympic runner, World War II bombardier, and POW survivor. After the war, he returned to the United States to found the Victory Boys Camp for at,risk youth and became an inspirational speaker. Zamperini's story was told in his 2003 autobiography Devil at My Heels, as well as in Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 biography Unbroken.David Rensin worked closely with Louis Zamperini for many years and cowrote Devil at My Heels, as well as fifteen other books, including five New York Times bestsellers.;"Louis Zamperini; David Rensin";238;2014;"Don't Give Up; Don't Give In: Lessons from an Extraordinary Life";history_biography

019969298X;eng;3.54;The nineteenth century seems to have been full of hysterical women , or so they were diagnosed. Where are they now? The very disease no longer exists. In this fascinating account, Andrew Scull tells the story of Hysteria , an illness that disappeared not through medical endeavour, but through growing understanding and cultural change. More generally, it raises the question of how diseases are framed, and how conceptions of a disease change through history. The lurid history of hysteria makes fascinating reading. Charcot's clinics showed off flamboyantly 'hysterical' patients taking on sexualized poses, and among the visiting professionals was one Sigmund Freud. Scull discusses the origins of the idea of hysteria, the development of a neurological approach by John Sydenham and others, hysteria as a fashionable condition, and its growth from the 17th century. Some regarded it as a peculiarly English malady, 'the natural concomitant of England's greater civilization and refinement'. Women were the majority of patients, and the illness became associated with female biology, resulting in some gruesome 'treatments'. Charcot and Freud were key practitioners defining the nature of the illness. But curiously, the illness seemed to swap gender during the First World War when male hysterics frequently suffering from shell shock were also subjected to brutal 'treatments'. Subsequently, the 'disease' declined and eventually disappeared, at least in professional circles, though attenuated elements remain, reclassified for instance as post,traumatic stress disorder.;Andrew Scull;240;2011;Hysteria: The Disturbing History;history_biography

Crossing the Bay of Bengalplaces this region at the heart of world history for the first time. Integrating human and environmental history, and mining a wealth of sources, Sunil Amrith gives a revelatory and stirring new account of the Bay and those who have inhabited it.For centuries the Bay of Bengal served as a maritime highway between India and China, and then as a battleground for European empires, all while being shaped by the monsoons and by human migration. Imperial powers in the nineteenth century, abetted by the force of capital and the power of steam, reconfigured the Bay in their quest for coffee, rice, and rubber. Millions of Indian migrants crossed the sea, bound by debt or spurred by drought, and filled with ambition. Booming port cities like Singapore and Penang became the most culturally diverse societies of their time. By the 1930s, however, economic, political, and environmental pressures began to erode the Bay s centuries,old patterns of interconnection.Today, rising waters leave the Bay of Bengal s shores especially vulnerable to climate change, at the same time that its location makes it central to struggles over Asia s future.

When economist and philosopher Adam Smith proclaimed that all our actions were motivated by self,interest, he used the example of the baker and the butcher as he laid the foundations for 'economic man.' He argued that the baker and butcher didn't give bread and meat out of the goodness of their hearts. It's an ironic point of view coming from a bachelor who lived with his mother for most of his life ,, a woman who cooked his dinner every night.Nevertheless, the economic man has dominated our understanding of modern,day capitalism, with a focus on self,interest and the exclusion of all other motivations. Such a view point disregards the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking. It insists that if women are paid less, then that's because their labor is worth less.

Met het bereiken van de Europese elite bij Internazionale in Milaan begon tevens zijn reis langs de toppen der waanzin. Hij ging miljoenen verdienen en uitgeven. Zijn naieve inborst en hang naar spektakel maakten van zijn leven een symfonie met ontelbaar veel mooie, treurige, valse en bizarre noten.

3462043269;ger;3.53;Uberlebensgross ist der Mythos Franz Kafka, dessen Nachruhm als Schriftsteller scheinbar mit einem weithin unglucklichen Leben erkauft wurde. Doch nun wirft Michael Kumpfmuller ein helles, fast heiteres Licht auf den beruhmten Dichter und zeichnet liebevoll und diskret einen Menschen, der in seinem letzten Jahr die grosse Liebe findet und sein Leben in die Hand nimmt, bevor es dafur zu spat ist. Im Sommer 1923 lernt der tuberkulosekranke Franz Kafka, als Dichter nur Eingeweihten bekannt, in einem Ostseebad die 25,jahrige Kochin Dora Diamant kennen. Und innerhalb weniger Wochen tut er, was er nicht fur moglich gehalten hat: Er entscheidet sich fur das Zusammenleben mit einer Frau, teilt Tisch und Bett mit Dora. In Berlin wagt er mit ihr das gemeinsame Leben, mitten in der Hyperinflation der Weimarer Republik. Den taglich kletternden Preisen, den wechselnden Untermietquartieren, den argwohnischen Eltern zum Trotz: Bis zu seinem Tod im Juni 1924 werden sich Franz Kafka und Dora Diamant, von wenigen Tagen abgesehen, nicht mehr trennen. Aus dieser wahren Geschichte macht Michael Kumpfmuller einen feinsinnigen, behutsamen und kenntnisreichen Liebesroman. Kafkas Tagebucher, seine Briefe und letzten Texte kennt er genau und webt sie zart in die Erzahlung ein. Aber ebenso sehr widmet er sich Doras Sicht, dem Blick der verliebten jungen Frau auf ihren ratselhaften, sterbenden Mann. Und so gelingt Kumpfmuller eine tief anruhrende Parabel uber das Leben und die Liebe, das Schreiben und den Tod.;Michael Kumpfmuller;239;2011;Die Herrlichkeit des Lebens;history_biography

1781220069;eng;4.00;Fighting for the Empire is the story of a remarkable Irishman, a staunch Catholic from Galway who served the British Crown and its Empire for almost fifty years. His extraordinary military career took in countless conflicts including two World Wars, Imperial adventures, acts of heroism and encounters with royalty. It also included a period of Irish history that split families and communities in two.Joining the Indian Medical Service in 1896 Thomas Kelly was posted to the turbulent North West Frontier almost as soon as he arrived in India. He was one of the first Westerners to set foot in the mysterious mountain city of Lhasa, winning a commendation along the way for an act for bravery that was illustrated on the front page of London newspapers.Kelly s many adventures brought him face to face with both hardships and glamour. His duties included entertaining Swedish Explorer Sven Hedin, King George V and later the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) who he despised, describing him as a drunkard and a womanizer.The First World War saw Kelly serving with the Indian Medical Service in Aden, Egypt and Mesopotamia (covering present,day Iraq, Syria, Iran and parts of Turkey), collecting the Distinguished Service Order as well as being commended in dispatches four times, including for his role in the aftermath of the infamous siege of Kut. The end of the First World War saw no letup as he was pitched into the brief and bloody 3rd Afghan War that raged across the notorious North West Frontier in 1919.Bitterly disappointed at being turned down by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of the Second World War (he was now 69) Kelly became ships surgeon in the Merchant Navy taking part in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Bordeaux as France fell to the German invaders. Going with the 8th Army to Egypt and serving on Atlantic convoys his service finally came to an end in late 1944 after serving on ships transporting troops for the invasion of Europe. His age (74) caught up with him and he was sent home still protesting that he was more than fit enough to remain at sea.Containing many photographs from Kelly s personal albums and private collections Fighting for the Empire is a fascinating look not just at an individual s bravery and hardships but at the closing years of the British Empire.;David Worsfold;240;2016;Fighting for the Empire: An Irish Doctor's Adventures Through Imperial Campaigns and Two World Wars;history_biography

Kissing the Swordcaptures the surreal experiences of serving time without being charged with a crime, and witnessing the systematic destruction of any and all opposition to fundamentalist power. It is a memoir filled with both horror and humor: nights blasted by the sounds of machine gun fire as hundreds of prisoners are summarily executed, and days spent debating prison officials on whether the Quran demands that women be covered. Parsipur, one of the great novelists of modern Iran, known for magic realism, tells a story here that is all too real. She mines her own painful memories to create an urgent call for one of the most basic of human rights: freedom of expression.Born in Iran in 1946, Shahrnush Parsipurbegan her career as a fiction writer and producer at Iranian National Television and Radio. She was imprisoned for nearly five years by the religious government without being formally charged. Shortly after her release, she published Women Without Menand was arrested and jailed again, this time for her frank and defiant portrayal of women's sexuality. While still banned in Iran, the novel became an underground bestseller there, and has been translated into many languages around the world.

After fighting with the Freikorps and in between the wars, he was serving with the 1st Panzer Division when the Polish campaign inaugurated World War II. Leading from the front, his exploits as commander of a panzer battalion earned him further decorations during the French campaign.Transferred to the newly formed 16th Panzer Division, Strachwitz participated in the invasion of Yugoslavia and then Operation Barbarossa where he earned the Knight's Cross. The following year, during the advance on Stalingrad, he won the Oak Leaves for destroying 270 Soviet tanks at Kalach. Now commander of a regiment, he reached the Volga and fought ferociously on the northern rim of Sixth Army s perimeter. Severely wounded during the battles, he was flown out of the Stalingrad pocket and was thus spared the fate of the rest of Sixth Army.Upon recuperation, Strachwitz was named commander of the Grossdeutschland Division s panzer regiment, and won the Swords to the Knight's Cross during Manstein's counteroffensive at Kharkov. After fighting through Kursk and the ensuing defensive battles, he was transferred the next year to Army Group North where he won the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross at Narva.For the rest of the war, sandwiched around a stay in hospital, Strachwitz commanded ad hoc battlegroups, and pioneered the formation of tank hunter brigades, consisting of deep,penetration infantry armed with panzerfausts and other demolitions who would ambush Soviet tanks.Wounded 12 times during the war, and barely surviving a lethal car crash, Strachwitz was finally able to surrender to the Americans in May 1945.Australian author/researcher Raymond Bagdonas, though impaired by the disappearance of 16th Panzer Division's official records at Stalingrad, and the fact that many of the Panzer Graf's later battlegroups never kept them, has nevertheless written an intensely detailed account of this combat leader s life, as well as ferocious armored warfare in World War II.;Raymond Bagdonas;357;2014;"The Devil's General: The Life of Hyazinth Graf Strachwitz; The Panzer Graf""";history_biography

Artists and poets have fathomed their deepest thoughts searching for the hill's hidden meanings, archaeologists have tunnelled through earth for fragments that prove its purpose. But for all this human endeavour, Silbury Hill remains a mystery. We do know it is the largest prehistoric mound in Europe. But was it once an island, moated by water? Was it a place of worship and celebration, perhaps a vast measure of the passing seasons? Along with Stonehenge and Avebury, was it part of a healing landscape or a physical memory of the long,ago dead? Silbury Hill is the sum of all that we project. A blank screen where human dreams and nightmares flicker. The hill has been part of Adam Thorpe's own life since his schooldays at Marlborough, which he would often escape in the surrounding downlands.

But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The Great War spelled the end of the Ottomans, unleashing powerful forces that would forever change the face of the Middle East.In The Fall of the Ottomans, award,winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region's crucial role in the conflict. Bolstered by German money, arms, and military advisors, the Ottomans took on the Russian, British, and French forces, and tried to provoke Jihad against the Allies in their Muslim colonies. Unlike the static killing fields of the Western Front, the war in the Middle East was fast,moving and unpredictable, with the Turks inflicting decisive defeats on the Entente in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Gaza before the tide of battle turned in the Allies' favor. The great cities of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and, finally, Damascus fell to invading armies before the Ottomans agreed to an armistice in 1918.The postwar settlement led to the partition of Ottoman lands between the victorious powers, and laid the groundwork for the ongoing conflicts that continue to plague the modern Arab world. A sweeping narrative of battles and political intrigue from Gallipoli to Arabia, The Fall of the Ottomansis essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the Great War and the making of the modern Middle East.;Eugene Rogan;486;2016;The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East;history_biography

From 1942 onwards, ordinary Parisian Jews,,mostly poor families and recent immigrants from Eastern Europe,,were robbed, not of sculptures or paintings, but of toys, saucepans, furniture, and sheets. Witnessing the Robbing of the Jews tells how this vast enterprise of plunder was implemented in the streets of Paris by analyzing images from an album of photographs found in the Federal Archives of Koblenz. Brought from Paris in 1945, the photographs were cataloged by the staff of the Munich Central Collecting Point. Beyond bearing witness to the petty acts of larceny, these images provide crucial information on how the Germans saw their work.

Before becoming a full,time musician he had a career as a schoolteacher, which culminated in his co,composition of the much,loved school musical Smike. Education is something Simon has always felt strongly about, and his teaching work continues to this day.Anchored by a large and loving family, Simon has led something of a charmed life, but , unusually , is happy to discuss his failures just as much as his successes, as he sees the value of learning from mistakes. Doof Doof is full of valuable advice to aspiring musicians and composers starting on their own careers.With a wealth of showbiz anecdotes, delivered with fluency and grace, Doof Doof is a vivid and engaging portrait of a successful composer, entrepreneurial businessman, earnest educator and committed family man.;Simon May;240;2015;Doof Doof: My Life in Music;history_biography

1471151050;eng;3.74;Eggs or Anarchy is one of the great, British stories of the Second World War yet to be told in full. It reveals the heroic tale of how Lord Woolton, Minister for Food, really fed Britain. As a nation at war, with supply routes under attack from the Axis powers and resources scarce, it was Woolton's job to fulfil his promise to the British people, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in particular, that there would be food on the shelves each week. Persuading the public to not resort to the black market and to manage on the very limited ration was one thing, but Woolton had to fulfil his side of the bargain and maintain supplies in time of crisis. A grammar school,educated genius, he was a fish out of water in Churchill's cabinet and the PM himself doubted Woolton would survive due to the unstinting criticism he faced from colleagues, the press and public.This is the story of how he battled to save his own career while using every trick in his entrepreneurial book to secure supplies. He battled to outwit unscrupulous dealers on the black market streets of cities within the British Empire , such as Alexandria in Eygpt , persuading customs authorities to turn a blind eye to his import schemes. If Britain had gone hungry the outcome of the war could have been very different. This book, for the first time, finds out the real story of how Lord Woolton provided food for Britain and her colonies and discovers that for him there were days when it was literally a choice of 'eggs or anarchy'.;William Sitwell;357;2016;Eggs or Anarchy: The remarkable story of the man tasked with the impossible: to feed a nation at war;history_biography

8862567197;ita;3.66;All'ombra della Sagrada Familia, tra i vicoli affascinanti di Barcellona si svolge la storia di Violeta e della sua famiglia. Il colore della memoria di Care Santos e un grande affresco spagnolo che attraversa vari secoli di storia e dopo i successi di Carlos Luis Zafon e Ildefonso Falcones ci regala ancora una volta uno scorcio inedito e intrigante della capitale catalana. Violeta, giovane esperta d'arte, riceve improvvisamente una lettera misteriosa da una donna italiana che vorrebbe incontrarla per rivelarle cose importanti, probabilmente un segreto. La ragazza accetta e di passaggio per Barcellona si ferma a visitare l'antica casa di famiglia, ricca di ricordi e di dipinti di suo nonno, un celebre pittore spagnolo, Amadeo Lax. Con questa piccola e apparentemente innocente incursione nel passato, Violeta si trovera ad affrontare la sua storia personale e quella della sua famiglia con un balzo a ottant'anni prima, nella Barcellona del 1932. Qui ebbe inizio la saga e l'intreccio di relazioni e segreti, finora rimasti sommersi, della famiglia Lax magistralmente descritta da Care Santos. E' infatti in una Vigilia di Natale del '32 che tutto comincio, mentre Maria del Roser Golorons, vedova Lax, esce con Conchita, amica e domestica, per fare gli ultimi regali. Mentre Maria si prepara felice a festeggiare il Natale, la citta, il Paese e la sua famiglia stanno per essere travolti dall'onda della Storia. Pochi anni dopo, in piena guerra civile, Amadeo Lax, pittore modernista e bizzarro, dipinge l'affresco piu bello che abbia mai fatto con un'intensita e una magia che lo renderanno capolavoro. E' il ritratto di sua moglie Teresa, da cui e stato abbandonato e a cui lui dona una bellezza e un mistero del tutto indecifrabili. Forse pero dietro quel quadro si nascondono forze, momenti oscuri e tenebre della famiglia Lax. Dalla Barcellona di inizio secolo, segnata dall'arte e dai caffe, in cui Violeta si immerge con il ricordo e con l'immaginazione, alla citta odierna in cui la donna cammina trascinata dalla bellezza prorompente dei palazzi e delle vie, Il colore della memoria ci racconta una storia al femminile, dove le donne sono eterne custodi di segreti e di passioni.;Care Santos;585;2012;Il colore della memoria;history_biography

Such was the case for Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle, scientists who frequently collaborate on book and museum exhibition projects. When the conversation turned to wine one evening, it almost inevitably led the two,,one a palaeoanthropologist, the other a molecular biologist,,to begin exploring the many intersections between science and wine. This book presents their fascinating, freewheeling answers to the question What can science tell us about wine? And vice versa.Conversational and accessible to everyone, this colorfully illustrated book embraces almost every imaginable area of the sciences, from microbiology and ecology (for an understanding what creates this complex beverage) to physiology and neurobiology (for insight into the effects of wine on the mind and body). The authors draw on physics, chemistry, biochemistry, evolution, and climatology, and they expand the discussion to include insights from anthropology, primatology, entomology, Neolithic archaeology, and even Classical history. The resulting volume is indispensible for anyone who wishes to appreciate wine to its fullest.;"Rob DeSalle; Ian Tattersall; Patricia J. Wynne";252;2015;A Natural History of Wine;history_biography
966925882;eng;4.19;Everyone knows about the ''Votes for Women'' campaign that led to the 19th Amendment in 1920. Few know just how long the struggle really was. Decades earlier, brave women began breaking the taboo of remaining silent at gatherings that included men. They began signing their names to petitions, flexing political muscle long before they had the vote. They wrote millions of words and published some of the most influential books and journals of their day. No one represents this early struggle ,, the small triumphs and discouraging setbacks ,, better than Clarina Howard Nichols (1810,1885), the Vermont newspaper publisher whose speeches made a powerful case for equality.Nichols, herself the victim of a failed marriage, was a magnet to abused and mistreated women and was their advocate at a time when her sex was just beginning to speak up. And when she felt progress wasn't coming soon enough, she moved west, to Bleeding Kansas, where she would make history and show the world that feminism could thrive on the frontier.Diane Eickhoff, who first wrote Nichols' biography in 2006 as Revolutionary Heart, has reimagined her story for all ages. Booklist declared, ''The name Clarina Nichols deserves to be placed next to those of such luminaries as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,'' and readers of this inspiring historical biography will heartily agree.;Diane Eickhoff;240;2016;Clarina Nichols: Frontier Crusader for Women's Rights;history_biography
670077860;eng;4.04;In January 2011, MONA was officially opened to the public. It was lauded as the most extraordinary cultural event for Australia since the opening of the Sydney Opera House. David Walsh was a largely mysterious art collector who had made a fortune gambling. He had collected ancient coins and antiquities and established a small museum of antiquities on his Moorilla estate but subsequently he became interested in art of all periods. In 2006, Walsh was the anonymous winning bidder of John Brack's The Bar, which the NGV had so publicly declared it was going to purchase. It was a move that kept the media and art circles guessing for some time and was, in its way, classic Walsh behaviour.Over several years he bought a huge number of works and he started thinking about a gallery space in which to house them. But a conventional museum wasn't what Walsh was after. He wanted to transform the viewer's experience of art. There began the earliest ideas for MONA, a museum of old and new art.Adrian Franklin, professor of sociology at the University of Tasmania, has pieced together the story of the creation of MONA, from how it came to be on the banks of the Derwent River, to the design and building process, the collection and branding and, crucially, designing the experience and effect that MONA has on its many millions of visitors.;Adrian Franklin;353;2014;The making of Mona;history_biography

231153260;eng;3.67;To understand business and its political, cultural, and economic context, it helps to view it historically, yet most business histories look no further back than the nineteenth century. The full sweep of business history actually begins much earlier, with the initial cities of Mesopotamia. In the first book to describe and explain these origins, Roberts depicts the society of ancient traders and consumers, tracing the roots of modern business and underscoring the relationship between early and modern business practice.Roberts's narrative begins before business, which he defines as selling to voluntary buyers at a profit. Before business, he shows, the material conditions and concepts for the pursuit of profit did not exist, even though trade and manufacturing took place. The earliest business, he suggests, arose with the long distance trade of early Mesopotamia, and expanded into retail, manufacturing and finance in these command economies, culminating in the Middle Eastern empires. (Part One) But it was the largely independent rise of business, money, and markets in classical Greece that produced business much as we know it. Alexander the Great's conquests and the societies that his successors created in their kingdoms brought a version of this system to the old Middle Eastern empires, and beyond. (Part Two) At Rome this entrepreneurial market system gained important new features, including business corporations, public contracting, and even shopping malls. The story concludes with the sharp decline of business after the 3rd century CE. (Part Three)In each part, Roberts portrays the major new types of business coming into existence. He weaves these descriptions into a narrative of how the prevailing political, economic, and social culture shaped the nature and importance of business and the status, wealth, and treatment of business people. Throughout, the discussion indicates how much (and how little) business has changed, provides a clear picture of what business actually is, presents a model for understanding the social impact of business as a whole, and yields stimulating insights for public policy today.;Keith Roberts;357;2011;"The Origins of Business; Money and Markets";history_biography

In The Invisible History of the Human Race, Christine Kenneally draws on cutting,edge research to reveal how both historical artifacts and DNA tell us where we come from and where we may be going. While some books explore our genetic inheritance and popular television shows celebrate ancestry, this is the first book to explore how everything from DNA to emotions to names and the stories that form our lives are all part of our human legacy. This book shows how trust is inherited in Africa, silence is passed down in Tasmania, and how the history of nations is written in our DNA. From fateful, ancient encounters to modern mass migrations and medical diagnoses, Kenneally explains how the forces that shaped the history of the world ultimately shape each human who inhabits it.

1848318529;eng;4.13;In 1915, Albert Einstein presented his masterwork to the Prussian Academy of Sciences , a theory of gravity, matter, space and time: the General Theory of Relativity. Einstein himself said it was 'the most valuable theory of my life', and 'of incomparable beauty'. It describes the evolution of the Universe, black holes, the behaviour of orbiting neutron stars, gravitational lensing, and why clocks run slower on the surface of the Earth than in space. It even suggests the possibility of time travel. And yet we think instead of 1905, the year of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and his equation E=mc2, as his annus mirabilis, even though the Special Theory is less far,reaching. Today the General Theory is overshadowed by these achievements, regarded as 'too difficult' for ordinary mortals to comprehend.

Multiple copies were made of that original which were distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the Chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154. Nine mss survive in whole or in part, tho not all are of equal historical value & none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the Chronicle is in the form of annals, by year. The earliest are dated 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain) & historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin.

747597480;eng;4.21;RICE'S ARCHITECTURAL PRIMER covers the grammar and vocabulary of British buildings, explaining the evolution of styles from Norman castles to Norman Foster. Its aim is to enable the reader to recognise, understand and date any British building.As Matthew Rice says, 'Once you can speak any language, conversation can begin, but without it communications can only be brief and brutish. The same is the case with Architecture: an inability to describe the component parts of a building leaves one tongue,tied and unable to begin to discuss what is or is not exciting, dull or peculiar about it.' RICE'S ARCHITECTURAL PRIMER will explain the language of architecture. With it in your hand, pocket or car, buildings will break down beguilingly into their component parts, ready for inspection and discussion. There will be no more references to that curly bit on top of the thing with the square protrusions. Ungainly and inept descriptions will be a thing of the past and, fluent in the world of volutes, hood moulds, lobed architraves and bucrania, you will be able to leave a cathedral or country house with as much to talk about as a film or play.RICE'S ARCHITECTURAL PRIMER starts with an explanation of the basic 'Grammar' of buildings: elevation, plan, roof, gable and eave. This will enable the reader to better make use of what is to follow. It will also cover the Orders of Architecture , Doric, Tuscan, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite , so that the vital basics of Classicism are covered. Following this is the 'Vocabulary'. This will be a chronological reference section covering, period by period, the windows, doors and doorcases, columns, chimneys, arches, balustrades and pediments that make up the built environment.;Matthew Rice;240;2010;Rice's Architectural Primer;history_biography

The long Chinese Civil War precipitated a long regional war between China and Japan that went global in 1941 when the Chinese found themselves fighting a civil war within a regional war within an overarching global war. The global war that consumed Western attentions resulted from Japan's peripheral strategy to cut foreign aid to China by attacking Pearl Harbor and Western interests throughout the Pacific on December 7,8, 1941. S. C. M. Paine emphasizes the fears and ambitions of Japan, China, and Russia, and the pivotal decisions that set them on a collision course in the 1920s and 1930s. The resulting wars , the Chinese Civil War (1911,1949), the Second Sino,Japanese War (1931,1945), and World War II (1939,1945) , together yielded a viscerally anti,Japanese and unified Communist China, the still,angry rising power of the early twenty,first century.

Michael Coveney's biography shines a light on the life and career of a truly remarkable performer, one whose stage and screen career spans six decades. From her days as a West End star of comedy and revue, Dame Maggie's path would cross with those of the greatest actors, playwrights and directors of the era. Whether stealing scenes from Richard Burton, answering back to Laurence Olivier, or playing opposite Judi Dench in Breath of Life, her career can be seen as a 'Who's Who' of British theatre. Her film and television career are just as starry. From the title character in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie andthe meddling chaperone in A Room With a Viewto the Harry Potter films in which she played Minerva McGonagall (as she put it 'Miss Jean Brodie in a wizard's hat') and the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel films in which she played the wise Muriel Donnelly, Smith has thrilled, engaged and made audiences laugh. As Violet Crawley, the formidable Dowager Countess of Downton Abbeyshe conquered millions more. Paradoxically she remains an enigmatic figure, rarely appearing in public. Michael Coveney's absorbing biography, written with the actress's blessing and drawing on personal archives, as well as interviews with immediate family and close friends, is a portrait of one of the greatest actors of our time.;Michael Coveney;353;2015;Maggie Smith;history_biography

However, they have also sparked conflict, as classical liberals split on a number of issues, such as legitimate exceptions to the presumption of liberty, the meaning of the public good, natural rights versus utilitarianism, the role of the state in education, and the rights of resistance and revolution. This book explores these conflicts and their implications for contemporary liberal and libertarian thought.;George H.

But as word spread of the discovery of gold, they soon became a regular sight in the American West. In San Francisco, a labyrinthine Chinatown arose where Chinese smuggled into the country were deposited.

Wharton's experiences in the army form the bedrock to this astonishing tale, from serving in Southern Iraq and with Prince Harry in Canada, to being hospitalized in a homophobic beating, to helping at the 7/7 bombings and serving at the Royal Wedding. His story is told right up until the point where he leaves the army in 2013 after a ten year commitment. The Army is certainly a different place now to when James signed up and there's no question that he's helped change opinions and make life easier for gay service people in the future. James was the first openly gay person to appear on the front cover of Soldier magazine, the British Army's official publication.

The tale begins with meals aboard balloons and zeppelins, where cooking was accomplished below explosive bags of hydrogen, ending with space station dinners that were cooked thousands of miles below. This book is the first to chart that history worldwide, exploring the intricacies of inflight dining from 1783 to the present day, aboard balloons, zeppelins, land,based aircraft and flying boats, jets, and spacecraft. It charts the ways in which commercial travelers were lured to try flying with the promise of familiar foods, explains the problems of each aerial environment and how chefs, engineers, and flight crew adapted to them, and tells the stories of pioneers in the field. Hygiene and sanitation were often difficult, and cultural norms and religious practices had to be taken into account. The history is surprising and sometimes humorous,,at times some ridiculous ideas were tried, and airlines offered some strange meals to try to attract passengers. It's an engrossing story with quite a few twists and turns, and this first book on the subject tells it with a light touch.;Richard Foss;233;2014;Food in the Air and Space: The Surprising History of Food and Drink in the Skies;history_biography

8804612959;ita;3.87;Fondata, secondo la tradizione, nell'814 a.C. sulle coste dell'odierna Tunisia dagli abitanti fenici di Tiro, Cartagine si trasformo a poco a poco da fiorente centro commerciale in capitale di un impero con numerose e ricche colonie in ampie zone del Mediterraneo occidentale (Sardegna, Sicilia, Spagna).Quando Roma estese la propria egemonia sull'Italia meridionale, il confronto fra le due potenze degenero in un interminabile e sanguinoso conflitto.Al termine della prima (264,241 a.C.) e della seconda (218,201 a.C.) guerra punica, combattute sulla penisola italica, in Sicilia e sul continente africano, e segnate dagli epici scontri di Canne e di Zama in cui si rivelo appieno il genio militare del cartaginese Annibale e del romano Scipione Africano, due dei massimi strateghi dell'antichita, fu chiaro che l'incontrastato dominio del Mediterraneo sarebbe toccato a Roma. Eppure, benche sconfitta, Cartagine era ancora cosi e minacciosa da indurre il senatore Marco Porcio Catone a concludere tutte le sue arringhe con l'implacabile monito a distruggerla (Carthago delenda est!). Cosa che avvenne nel 146 a.C., quando, al termine della terza guerra punica, le truppe romane al comando di Scipione Emiliano la rasero al suolo, quasi per cancellarne anche la memoria.Per tracciare la prima storia completa delle vicende politiche e militari, delle istituzioni e dello scenario culturale e religioso di una delle piu grandi civilta del mondo antico, Richard Miles sfida le narrazioni partigiane degli storici greci e romani, interroga criticamente le fonti, smascherandone le tendenziosita, le lacune e le manipolazioni, e combina sapientemente testimonianze archeologiche e letterarie. Il ritratto che ne emerge e quello di una citta caratterizzata da una straordinaria vitalita economica, da una vocazione all'eclettismo e da una spiccata apertura verso altre culture.Nel ristabilire la verita dei fatti, Miles non solo ripara il torto storiografico subito da Cartagine, ma incrina profondamente la schematica visione di un mondo greco,romano come unico faro di civilta in un contesto di incultura e barbarie, segnalando cosi la necessita di una riflessione autocritica sulle radici dell'Occidente.;"Richard Miles; Aldo Piccato";488;2011;Carthago delenda est;history_biography

Over the last 1400 years, from origins in Arabia, a succession of Muslim polities and later empires expanded to control territories and peoples that ultimately stretched from southern France to East Africa and South East Asia.Yet many of the contributions of Muslim thinkers, scientists and theologians, not to mention rulers, statesmen and soldiers, have been occluded. This book rescues from oblivion and neglect some of these personalities and institutions while offering the reader a new narrative of this lost Islamic history. The Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans feature in the story, as do Muslim Spain, the savannah kingdoms of West Africa and the Mughal Empire, along with the later European colonization of Muslim lands and the development of modern nation,states in the Muslim world. Throughout, the impact of Islamic belief on scientific advancement, social structures, and cultural development is given due prominence, and the text is complemented by portraits of key personalities, inventions and little known historical nuggets.

CorralA deeply divided nation. Vicious politics. A shamelessly partisan media. A president loathed by half the populace. Smuggling and gang warfare along the Mexican border. Armed citizens willing to stand their ground and take law into their own hands...That was America in 1881.All those forces came to bear on the afternoon of October 26th when Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers faced off against the Clantons and the McLaurys in Tombstone, Arizona. It should have been a simple misdemeanor arrest. Thirty seconds and thirty bullets later, three officers were wounded and three citizens lay dead in the dirt.Wyatt Earp was the last man standing, the only one unscathed. The lies began before the smoke cleared, but the gunfight at the O.K. Corral would soon become central to American beliefs about the Old West.Epitaph tells Wyatt's real story, unearthing the Homeric tragedy buried under 130 years of mythology, misrepresentation, and sheer indifference to fact. Epic and intimate, this novel gives voice to the real men and women whose lives were changed forever by those fatal 30 seconds in Tombstone. At its heart is the woman behind the myth: Josephine Sarah Marcus, who loved Wyatt Earp for forty,nine years and who carefully chipped away at the truth until she had crafted the heroic legend that would become the epitaph her husband deserved.;Mary Doria Russell;581;2015;Epitaph: A Novel of the O.K.

195397932;eng;4.25;There are few moments in American history in which the course of events tipped so suddenly and so dramatically as at the Battle of Midway. At dawn of June 4, 1942, a rampaging Japanese navy ruled the Pacific. By sunset, their vaunted carrier force (the Kido Butai) had been sunk and their grip on the Pacific had been loosened forever.In this absolutely riveting account of a key moment in the history of World War II, one of America's leading naval historians, Craig L. Symonds paints an unforgettable portrait of ingenuity, courage, and sacrifice. Symonds begins with the arrival of Admiral Chester A. Nimitz at Pearl Harbor after the devastating Japanese attack, and describes the key events leading to the climactic battle, including both Coral Sea,,the first battle in history against opposing carrier forces,,and Jimmy Doolittle's daring raid of Tokyo. He focuses throughout on the people involved, offering telling portraits of Admirals Nimitz, Halsey, Spruance and numerous other Americans, as well as the leading Japanese figures, including the poker,loving Admiral Yamamoto. Indeed, Symonds sheds much light on the aspects of Japanese culture,,such as their single,minded devotion to combat, which led to poorly armored planes and inadequate fire,safety measures on their ships,,that contributed to their defeat. The author's account of the battle itself is masterful, weaving together the many disparate threads of attack,,attacks which failed in the early going,,that ultimately created a five,minute window in which three of the four Japanese carriers were mortally wounded, changing the course of the Pacific war in an eye,blink.Symonds is the first historian to argue that the victory at Midway was not simply a matter of luck, pointing out that Nimitz had equal forces, superior intelligence, and the element of surprise. Nimitz had a strong hand, Symonds concludes, and he rightly expected to win.;Craig L. Symonds;452;2011;The Battle of Midway;history_biography

From 1943 until 1951, Ian Malcolm was a radio officer/purser with Alfred Holt and Co., owners of the Blue Funnel Line and the Glen Line.

Subsequent voyages were made to the Continent, Far East, Australia and Indonesia.His first ship was, on two occasions, prevented from passing through the Mediterranean.

The book tells the adventures of the real boy who came to London and became a well,known figure more than a hundred years before James Barrie penned his classic. Peter the Wild Boy lived in eighteenth century England, through the reigns of three kings (all named George), and achieved legendary status in his own lifetime.

Peter retained a youthful appearance throughout his life, and had a joyful, intuitive spirit that was both challenging and infectious. This imaginative dramatization of the life of Peter the Wild Boy captures the joy, innocence and fire of a bright, feral child living in the midst of the Age of Enlightenment. It is narrated by the girl who perhaps knew him best. The epic story of his life, spanning approximately seventy years, navigates a tumultuous and thoughtful period in English history, rich with characters.

It was fought over the territory of East Pakistan, which seceded to become Bangladesh. Through a detailed investigation of events on the ground, Sarmila Bose contextualizes and humanizes the war while analyzing what the events reveal about the nature of the conflict itself.The story of 1971 has so far been dominated by the narrative of the victorious side. All parties to the war are still largely imprisoned by wartime partisan mythologies. Bose reconstructs events through interviews conducted in Bangladesh and Pakistan, published and unpublished reminiscences in Bengali and English of participants on all sides, official documents, foreign media reports and other sources. Her book challenges assumptions about the nature of the conflict and exposes the ways in which the 1971 conflict is still being played out in the region.;Sarmila Bose;239;2011;Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War;history_biography

615835325;eng;4.15;The temple doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter,day Saints is unique. Understanding its origin and development through the experiences of Wilford Woodruff will answer questions posed by individuals inside and outside of the Church. What is the relationship of temple ordinances and Old Testament rituals? Why have some ordinances been discontinued? Why did married women choose to be sealed to Joseph Smith? What is priesthood adoption? When were proxy ordinances introduced?Many books and articles address a specific temple ordinance or a period of time in Mormon history, but the development of all temple ordinances has never been included in a single volume , until now.Jennifer Mackley's meticulously researched biographical narrative chronicles the development of temple doctrine through the examination of Wilford Woodruff's personal life. The account unfolds in Woodruff's own words, drawn from primary sources including journals, discourses, and letters. Mackley elucidates the doctrine's sixty,year progression from Old Testament practices of washings and anointings in the 1830s, to the endowment, sealings, and priesthood adoptions in the 1840s, through all of the vicarious ordinances for the dead in the 1870s, to the sealing of multigenerational families in the 1890s. Her narrative is enhanced by 120 archival images (some previously unpublished), as well as extensive footnotes and citations for the reader's further study.

And, indeed, since the Holocaust and the end of World War II, Europeans in particular have been consumed by remorse. But Pascal Bruckner argues that guilt has now gone too far. It has become a pathology, and even an obstacle to fighting today's atrocities. Bruckner, one of France's leading writers and public intellectuals, argues that obsessive guilt has obscured important realities. The West has no monopoly on evil, and has destroyed monsters as well as created them,,leading in the abolition of slavery, renouncing colonialism, building peaceful and prosperous communities, and establishing rules and institutions that are models for the world. The West should be proud,,and ready to defend itself and its values. In this, Europeans should learn from Americans, who still have sufficient self,esteem to act decisively in a world of chaos and violence. Lamenting the vice of anti,Americanism that grips so many European intellectuals, Bruckner urges a renewed transatlantic alliance, and advises Americans not to let recent foreign,policy misadventures sap their own confidence. This is a searing, provocative, and psychologically penetrating account of the crude thought and bad politics that arise from excessive bad conscience.;"Pascal Bruckner; Steven Rendall";239;2010;The Tyranny of Guilt: An Essay on Western Masochism;history_biography

Her training in the Classics allows her to capture the stark contrast between Paul's Christianity and the violence, exploitation, and dehumanization permeating the Roman Empire in his era. In contrast to later distortions, the vision of Christian life Ruden finds in Paul is centered on equality before God and the need for people to love one another.A remarkable work of scholarship, synthesis, and understanding, Paul Among the People recaptures the moral urgency and revolutionary spirit that made Christianity such a shock to the ancient world and laid the foundation of the culture in which we live today.;Sarah Ruden;240;2011;Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in His Own Time;history_biography

Rywka's Diary is at once an astonishing historical document and a moving tribute to the many ordinary people whose lives were forever altered by the Holocaust. At its heart, it is the diary of a girl named Rywka Lipszyc who detailed the brutal conditions that Jews in the Lodz ghetto, the second largest in Poland, endured under the Nazis: poverty, hunger and malnutrition, religious oppression, and, in Rywka's case, the death of her parents and siblings. Handwritten in a school notebook between October 1943 and April 1944, the diary ends literally in mid,sentence. What became of Rywka is a mystery. A Red Army doctor found her notebook in Auschwitz after its liberation in 1945 and took it back with her to the Soviet Union.Rywka's Diary is also a moving coming,of,age story, in which a young woman expresses her curiosity about the world and her place in it and reflects on her relationship with God,,a remarkable affirmation of her commitment to Judaism and her faith in humanity. Interwoven into this carefully translated diary are photographs, news clippings, maps, and commentary from Holocaust scholars and the girl's surviving relatives, which provide an in,depth picture of both the conditions of Rywka's life and the mysterious end to her diary.Moving and illuminating, told by a brave young girl whose strong and charismatic voice speaks for millions, Rywka's Diary is an extraordinary addition to the history of the Holocaust and World War II;"Alexandra Zapruder; Rywka Lipszyc; Anita Friedman; Malgorzata Markoff; Ewa Wiatr; Judy Janec; Fred Rosenbaum; Hadassa Halamish; Esther Burstein; Zinaida Berezovskaya";240;2015;Rywka's Diary: The Writings of a Jewish Girl from the Lodz Ghetto;history_biography

A partire dal Rinascimento l'immagine piu diffusa era quella di una citta in abbandono, disseminata di rovine. In molti si compiacevano nel sottolineare l'avidita, la meschinita e l'ignoranza dei romani del Medioevo, opponendo i loro vizi alle eroiche virtu dei loro piu lontani antenati. La Citta eterna e i suoi abitanti, invece, meritano ben altro approccio. La loro storia deve essere ristudiata, per mettersi alla pari con quella dei principali centri urbani dell'Italia comunale: Firenze, Milano o Venezia. E questa la scommessa che Jean,Claude Maire Vigueur ha raccolto scrivendo questo volume, che ci restituisce la Roma, largamente sconosciuta, dei secoli XII, XIII e XIV. In questa sintesi, non priva di spirito, si snoda il racconto dell'intera esperienza comunale romana. Racconto in cui appaiono, fianco a fianco, baroni e capipopolo, grandi proprietari terrieri e semplici braccianti, ricchi mercanti, cardinali e artisti, in uno scenario che alterna antiche vestigia architettoniche e campanili medievali, sontuose cerimonie religiose e sfrenate feste di quartiere.

Barely two years later, her life would make a drastic change,,and so would the lives of a group of girls half a world away.I chose the name of my tea shop,,Dr. Bombay's Underwater Tea Party,,because it sounded whimsical. India wasn't part of the equation. Not even remotely. I didn't do yoga. I had no deep yearning to see the Taj Mahal or tour Hindu temples. Indian food? I could take it or leave it.Yet on a whim, Katrell did go. She witnessed the throngs at the Ganges River, toured the tea fields of Darjeeling, and helped string pearls in conservative Hyderabad. But it was in a crowded Buddhist orphanage where she crossed paths with some girls who would change the course of her life.One night we had a conversation about their futures. What did they hope to be when they grew up? They didn't have any answers. The fear that consumed them was leaving the orphanage. What would happen on the day they were asked to gather their things and leave,,to walk out the door and be all alone on the street with no one to turn to and nowhere to go?With her mind racing about their grim futures, Katrell reached the simple conclusion that she couldn't walk away. So instead she walked forward,,on a mission to help them in any small way. Once back at her shop, an idea for The Learning Tea was born. By selling tea, cupcakes, scones, and other treats, Katrell raised enough funds to provide life necessities for the girls,,safe housing, uniforms, medical care, tutoring, and ultimately, a college education for each of them. To date, The Learning Tea has helped eleven young girls who once faced the bleakest of futures.Tiger Heartrecounts Katrell's riveting adventures back to India, through the chaotic streets of Mumbai, to tiny villages with roadside tea huts and hot samosas, to elephant crossings and snow,capped mountain switchbacks of the Himalayas,,an unexpected backdrop where she fell in love with a country that was gorgeous and heartbreaking all at once, where tragedy, humor, resilience and kindness were inextricably bound.

In this book he shines a spotlight on a secret world of ships, prayers for good fortune, satirical cartoons, charms, curses, windmills, word puzzles, architectural plans and heraldic designs. Drawing on examples from surviving medieval churches in England and Wales, the author gives a voice to the secret graffiti artists: from the lord of the manor and the parish priest to the people who built the church itself.Here are strange medieval beasts, knights battling unseen dragons, ships sailing across lime,washed oceans and demons who stalk the walls. Latin prayers for the dead jostle with medieval curses, builders' accounts and slanderous comments concerning a long,dead archdeacon.

And when Tootoo was drafted by Nashville in 2000 and made the Predators out of camp in 2003, he became a leader in another way: the first player of Inuk descent to suit up in the NHL.The stress of competition in the world's top hockey league, the travel, the media, the homesickness,,and the added pressure to hold one's head high as a role model not only for the young people of his hometown of Rankin Inlet but for the culture that had given him the strength and the opportunities to succeed,,would have been more than enough to challenge any rookie. But Tootoo faced something far more difficult: the loss of his brother in the year between his draft and his first shift for the Predators. Though he played through it, the tragedy took its inevitable toll. In 2010, Tootoo checked himself into rehab for alcohol addiction. It seemed a promising career had ended too soon.But that's not the way Tootoo saw it and not the way it would end. As heir to a cultural legacy that included alcohol, despair, and suicide, Tootoo could also draw on a heritage that could help sustain him even thousands of miles away from Nunavut. And in a community haunted by the same hopelessness and substance abuse that so affected Tootoo's life, it is not just his skill and fearlessness on the ice that have made him a hero, but the courage of his honesty to himself and to the world around him that he needed to rely on others to sustain him through his toughest challenge.All the Way tells the story of someone who has travelled far from home to realize a dream, someone who has known glory and cheering crowds, but also the demons of despair. It is the searing, honest tale of a young man who has risen to every challenge and nearly fallen short in the toughest game of all, while finding a way to draw strength from his community and heritage, and giving back to it as well.;"Stephen Brunt; Jordin Tootoo";240;2014;All the Way;history_biography

The weirdly alien notion of a space,time abyss from which nothing escapes,,not even light,,seemed to confound all logic. This engrossing book tells the story of the fierce black hole debates and the contributions of Einstein and Hawking and other leading thinkers who completely altered our view of the universe.Renowned science writer Marcia Bartusiak shows how the black hole helped revive Einstein's greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity, after decades during which it had been pushed into the shadows.

And will he save himself from that most insidious of enemies: the enemy within?For when you lose yourself, you lose everything.*** Note From The AuthorThe Historicity of Blood For Blood.The foundation for Blood For Blood came from two main ideas. The first of which was to include a witchcraft trial in the novel. Secondly, I wanted the plot to be driven within the backdrop of historical events. In other words, to weave the plot through historical events, which acted as a catalyst in the lives of the fictional main characters. Some (There are others, but I won't include them because of potential plot spoilers) of these historical events include:1.The Battle of Worcester, 1651,, The Battle of Worcester in 1651 ended in victory for Cromwell and ended the Civil War. Charles barely escaped Worcester and only after weeks on the run, managed to find sanctuary on the continent. Thereafter, Charles worked through his loyal agents as they plotted the downfall of Cromwell.2.Witch trials ,The last witchcraft trial in England that resulted in hangings was in Bideford in 1682. I wanted to highlight the terrible and unbelievable injustices perpetrated against women,,and sometimes men,,during these sad times.3.Penruddock's Uprising.4.Cromwell's new government of the Major,Generals,,introduced to protect the protectorate against rebellion, and to introduce 'Godly reform' after the failure of the Western Design in the Caribbean.5.The Earl of Rochester's participation in Penruddock's Uprising as the king's representative.Sometimes history is stranger than fiction!;D.S.

Ma Charis e Glicera pensano che i padri vivano fuori dal mondo: per loro il giovane Cimone, figlio di Eubulo, ricco, disinvolto e arrogante, e un oggetto di sogni segreti.E cosi che, quando tutti gli uomini si radunano in citta per la prima rappresentazione di una commedia di Aristofane, le ragazze violano tutte le regole di una societa patriarcale e accettano di entrare in casa di Cimone, lontane dagli occhi severi dei padri.Ma mentre in teatro l'ateniese Lisistrata e la spartana Lampito decretano il primo, incredibile sciopero delle donne contro gli uomini per invocare la fine di tutte le guerre, la notte nella villa di Eubulo prende una piega drammatica.Con la sua straordinaria capacita di far rivivere per noi la storia tra le pagine, Alessandro Barbero compie un'operazione affascinante e spregiudicata: mette in scena nell'Atene classica un dramma sinistramente attuale e al tempo stesso porta sul palcoscenico una commedia antica facendoci divertire e appassionare come se fossimo i suoi primi spettatori.Le Ateniesie un romanzo sorprendente, a tratti durissimo, che narra con potenza visionaria la lotta di classe, l'eterna deriva di sopraffazione degli uomini sulle donne, l'innocenza e la testardaggine di queste ultime, la necessita per gli uni e le altre di molto coraggio per cambiare il corso della storia.;Alessandro Barbero;216;2015;Le ateniesi;history_biography

The Moor's Last Stand presents the poignant story of Boabdil, the last Muslim king of Granada. Betrayed by his family and undermined by faction and internal conflict, Boabdil was defeated in 1492 by the forces of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of the newly united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. The Christian victory marked the completion of the long Christian re,conquest of Spain and ended seven centuries in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews had, for the most part, lived peacefully and profitably together. Five centuries after his death, Boabdil continues to be a potent symbol of resistance to the forces of western Christendom, and his image endures in contemporary culture. Based on original research in the region by a leading historian of Granada, this book presents a vivid account of Boabdil's life and times and considers the impact of his defeat then and now.;Elizabeth Drayson;232;2017;The Moor's Last Stand: How Seven Centuries of Muslim Rule in Spain Came to an End;history_biography

From February to July 2010, he lived in silence, solitude, and cold. His cabin, built by Soviet geologists in the Brezhnev years, was a cube of logs three metres by three metres, heated by a cast iron skillet, a six,day walk from the nearest village.To live isolated from the world while retaining one's sanity requires a routine, Tesson discovered. In the morning, he would read, write, smoke or draw, and then devote hours to cutting wood, shovelling snow and fishing. Emotionally, these months proved a challenge, and the loneliness was crippling. Noting carefully, almost daily, his impressions of the silence, his struggles to survive in a hostile nature, his despair, his doubts, but also moments of ecstasy, inner peace and harmony with natue, Sylvain Teson shares with us an extraordinary experience.;Sylvain Tesson;239;2012;Consolations of the Forest;history_biography

1471137481;eng;3.74;My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing is a highly personal account of Gordon Brown's Scotland, the nation he was born in, and our Britain, the multinational state that the Scots, English, Welsh and Northern Irish have created and share.Laying bare his family's ancestry over 300 years of the Union and explaining how it shaped his background, Brown charts what it was like growing up in Scotland in the 1950s and 1960s, and explains the influence of religion, education and Scotland's unique industrial structure on the shaping of his and Scotland's identity. He sets out the dramatic economic, social and cultural changes of the past fifty years and the vastly different prospects his children will face, demonstrating that a sense of Scottish national identity has always remained strong and how Scottish institutions have always fiercely guarded their independence.The referendum should not be seen as a battle between Scotland and Britain, he argues, but one between two visions of Scotland's future: one that sees Scotland prosper with a strong Scottish Parliament that is part of the UK, and one that severs all the political links Scots have with the UK. Brown puts forward his proposal for a constitutional settlement that could unite the country, and argues that in tune with Scotland's history of deep engagement with the wider world , as inventors, explorers, traders, missionaries, business leaders and aid workers , the best future for Scots is not to leave Britain, but to continue to shape it.;Gordon Brown;354;2014;"My Scotland; Our Britain: A Future Worth Sharing";history_biography

1742377602;eng;3.74;From the crowded tenements of Edinburgh to the Female Factory nestling in the shadow of Mt Wellington, dozens of Scottish women convicts were exiled to Van Diemen's Land with their young children. This is a rich and evocative account of the lives of women at the bottom of society two hundred years ago.Description'Her superb research and sympathetic reconstructions of nineteenth,century Scotland and Australia bring to life a long,forgotten but fascinating group of women.' , Si?n Rees, author of The Floating BrothelIn the early nineteenth century, crofters and villagers streamed into the burgeoning cities of Scotland, and families splintered. Orphan girls, single mothers and women on their own all struggled to feed and clothe themselves. For some, petty theft became a part of life. Any woman deemed 'habite & repute a thief' might find herself before the High Court of Justiciary, tried for yet another minor theft and sentenced to transportation 'beyond Seas'.Lucy Frost memorably paints the portrait of a boatload of women and their children who arrived in Hobart in 1838. Instead of serving time in prison, the women were sent to work as unpaid servants in the houses of settlers. Feisty Scottish convicts, unaccustomed to bowing and scraping, often irritated their middle,class employers, who charged them with insolence, or refusing to work, or getting drunk. A stint in the female factory became their punishment.Many women survived the convict system and shaped their own lives once they were free. They married, had children and found a place in the community. Others, though, continued to be plagued by errors and disasters until death.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LUCY FROST has spent a career researching and writing about nineteenth,century women.

Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland maneuvered from Tennessee to north Georgia in a bid to rout Confederate general Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee and blaze the way for further Union advances. Meanwhile, Confederate reinforcements bolstered the numbers of the Army of Tennessee, and by the time the two armies met at the Battle of Chickamauga, in northern Georgia, the Confederates had gained numerical superiority.Although the Confederacy won its only major victory west of the Appalachians, it failed to achieve the truly decisive results many high,ranking Confederates expected. In The Chickamauga Campaign,Steven E. Woodworth assembles eight thought,provoking new essays from an impressive group of authors to offer new insight into the complex reasons for this substantial, yet ultimately barren, Confederate victory.This broad collection covers every angle of the campaign, from its prelude to its denouement, from the points of view of key players of all ranks on both sides. In addition to analyzing the actions taken by Union leaders Thomas L. Crittenden, Alexander McCook, and James S. Negley, and Confederate commanders Braxton Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, Daniel Harvey Hill, Thomas C. Hindman, James Longstreet, and Alexander P. Stewart, the book probes the campaign's impact on morale in the North and South, and concludes with an essay on the campaign's place in Civil War memory. The final essay pays particular attention to Union veteran Henry Van Ness Boynton, the founder and developer of Chickamauga and Chattanooga State Military Park, whose achievements helped shape how the campaign would be remembered.This second volume in the Civil War Campaigns in the Heartland seriesprovides a profound understanding of the campaign's details as well as its significance to Civil War history.Contributors:John R.

1782271554;eng;3.93;Stefan Zweig was a leading talisman of a united Europe of unfettered movement, of pro,active cultural exchange, humane decency and tolerance, all polar opposites of the Nationalist regimes he loathed, and which came to power in the 1930s. In these poignant essays and addresses, forged in the last years or even months of his life, he shows his profound concern for and dedication to the survival of Europe's spiritual integrity.These essays form the natural accompaniment to Zweig's renowned memoir The World of Yesterday, registering the same themes and evoking the same nostalgia for a world brutally consigned to history. They can be seen as a vital addendum to that major work or as a prefiguration. But perhaps even more so than the prose of the memoir, these essays, few in number but rich in content, reveal the essence of Zweig's thought.;"Stefan Zweig; Will Stone";216;2016;Messages from a Lost World: Europe on the Brink;history_biography

Between April 1942 and October 1943, about 250,000 Jews from European countries and the Soviet Union were sent to the Nazi death camp at Sobibor in occupied Poland. Sobibor was not a transit camp or work camp: its sole purpose was efficient mass murder. On October 14, 1943, approximately half of the 650 or so prisoners still alive at Sobibor undertook a daring and precisely planned revolt, killing SS officers and fleeing through minefields and machine,gun fire into the surrounding forests, farms, and towns. Only about forty,two of them, including Fiszel, are known to have survived to the end of the war.Philip (Fiszel) Bialowitz, now an American citizen, tells his eyewitness story here in the real,time perspective of his own boyhood, from his childhood before the war and his internment in the brutal Izbica ghetto to his harrowing six months at Sobibor,,including his involvement in the revolt and desperate mass escape,,and his rescue by courageous Polish farmers. He also recounts the challenges of life following the war as a teenaged displaced person, and his eventual efforts as a witness to the truth of the Holocaust.In 1943 the heroic leaders of the revolt at Sobibor, Sasha Perchersky and Leon Feldhendler, implored fellow prisoners to promise that anyone who survived would tell the story of Sobibor: not just of the horrific atrocities committed there, but of the courage and humanity of those who fought back.

His late 1970s science fiction series Survivorsand Blake's 7 have been durable, cult and critical hits, both being remade 30 years later. His most famous creations, the Daleks, ensured, and at times eclipsed, the success of Doctor Who. Indeed, almost half a century after their first appearance in 1963, new additions to Dalekmythology continue to be made, while the word itself has entered the Oxford English Dictionary, passing into the language as the name of the most famous race of aliens in fiction. While his science fiction work remains at the core of his appeal, Nation also had a role to play in the early days of radio and television comedy,,as part of the legendary Associated London Scripts, he wrote for Spike Milligan, Tony Hancock, and Frankie Howerd,,and in the internationally successful adventure series of the 1960s: The Avengers, The Saint, The Persuaders!, and others.

230115713;eng;3.67;A new portrait of the two,time Nobel winner and her two daughters.Focusing on the first family in science, this biography of Marie Curie plumbs the recesses of her relationships with her two daughters, extraordinary in their own right, and presents the legendary scientist to us in a fresh way.Although the common image is that of a shy introvert toiling away in her laboratory, highly praised science writer Shelley Emling shows how Marie Curie was nothing short of an iconoclast. Her affair with a younger and married man drew the enmity of a xenophobic French establishment, who denied her entry to the Academy of Sciences and tried to expel her from France. But she was determined to live life how she saw fit, and passed on her resilience to her daughters. Emling draws on personal letters released by Curie's only granddaughter to show how Marie influenced her daughters yet let them blaze their own paths. Irene followed her mother's footsteps into science and was instrumental in the discovery of nuclear fission. Eve traveled the world as a foreign correspondent and then moved on to humanitarian missions.Emling also shows how Curie, following World War I, turned to America for help. Few people know about Curie's close friendship with American journalist Missy Meloney, who arranged speaking tours across the country for Marie and Eve and Irene. Months on the road, charming audiences both large and small, endeared the Curies to American women and established a lifelong relationship with the United States that formed one of the strongest connections of Marie's life. Without the financial support of American women, Marie might not have been able to go on with her research.Continuing the family story into the third generation, Emling also interviews Marie Curie's granddaughter Helene Joliot,Curie, who is an accomplished physicist in her own right. She reveals why her grandmother was a lot more than just a scientist and how Marie's trips to America forever changed her. Factually rich, personal and original, this is an engrossing story about the most famous woman in science that rips the cover off the myth and reveals the real person, friend, and mother behind it.;Shelley Emling;219;2012;Marie Curie and Her Daughters: The Private Lives of Science's First Family;history_biography

801450853;eng;3.96;The Politics of Voter Suppressionarrives in time to assess actual practices at the polls this fall and to reengage with debates about voter suppression tactics such as requiring specific forms of identification. Tova Andrea Wang examines the history of how U.S. election reforms have been manipulated for partisan advantage and establishes a new framework for analyzing current laws and policies. The tactics that have been employed to suppress voting in recent elections are not novel, she finds, but rather build upon the strategies used by a variety of actors going back nearly a century and a half. This continuity, along with the shift to a Republican domination of voter suppression efforts for the past fifty years, should inform what we think about reform policy today.Wang argues that activities that suppress voting are almost always illegitimate, while reforms that increase participation are nearly always legitimate. In short, use and abuse of election laws and policies to suppress votes has obvious detrimental impacts on democracy itself. Such activities are also harmful because of their direct impacts on actual election outcomes. Wang regards as beneficial any legal effort to increase the number of Americans involved in the electoral system. This includes efforts that are focused on improving voter turnout among certain populations typically regarded as supporting one party, as long as the methods and means for boosting participation are open to all. Wang identifies and describes a number of specific legitimate and positive reforms that will increase voter turnout.;Tova Andrea Wang;216;2012;The Politics of Voter Suppression: Defending and Expanding Americans Right to Vote (A Century Foundation Book);history_biography

Evangeline blijkt zelf in de traditie van de Angelogisten te staan. Ze begint haar missie te begrijpen. Samen met Verlaine zal ze om te achterhalen wat de Nephilim van plan zijn en zo de aarde te behoeden van de ondergang al haar moed en kennis moeten aanwenden.

Frequently, they are surprised to learn that there are different sign languages in different nations worldwide, as well as variations of these languages. These variations depend on social factors such as region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and race. One variation, Black ASL, has been recognized for years as a distinct form of sign language but only through anecdotal reports. This volume and its accompanying DVD present the first empirical study that begins to fill in the linguistic gaps about Black ASL.The powerful cast of contributors to The Hidden Treasure of Black ASLconsidered three questions in their study. First, what was the sociohistorical reality that made a separate variety of ASL possible? Second, what are the features of the variety of ASL that people call Black ASL? Third, can the same kind of unique features that have been identified in African American English be identified in Black ASL? This groundbreaking book and its companion DVD go far in answering these questions while also showing the true treasures of Black ASL.;"Ceil Lucas; Carolyn McCaskill; Robert J.

1594033757;eng;3.96;In what we tell ourselves is an age of reason, we are behaving increasingly irrationally. An astonishing number of people subscribe to celebrity endorsed cults, Mayan armageddon prophecies, scientism, and other varieties of new age, anti,enlightenment philosophies. Millions more advance popular conspiracy theories: AIDS was created in a CIA laboratory, Princess Diana was assassinated, and the 9/11 attacks were an inside job.In The World Turned Upside Down, Melanie Phillips explains that the basic cause of this explosion of irrationality is the slow but steady marginalization of religion. We tell ourselves that faith and reason are incompatible, but the opposite is the case. It was Christianity and the Hebrew Bible, Phillips asserts, that gave us our concepts of reason, progress, and an orderly world on which science and modernity are based.Without its religious traditions, the West has drifted into mass derangement where truth and lies, right and wrong, victim and aggressor are all turned upside down. Scientists skeptical of global warming are hounded from their posts, Israel is demonized, and the US is vilified over the war on terror,,all on the basis of blatant falsehoods and obscene propaganda.Worst of all, asserts Phillips, this abandonment of rationality leaves the West vulnerable to its legitimate threats. Faced with the very real challenges of spiraling demographics and violent, confrontational Islamism, the West is no longer willing or able to defend the modernity and rationalism that it once brought into being.;Melanie Phillips;486;2010;"The World Turned Upside Down: The Global Battle over God; Truth; and Power";history_biography

Basing her findings on thirteen months of ethnographic work with the two parties in Lahore, Humeira Iqtidar proposes that these Islamists are involuntarily facilitating secularization within Muslim societies, even as they vehemently oppose secularism.This book offers a fine,grained account of the workings of both parties that challenges received ideas about the relationship between the ideology of secularism and the processes of secularization. Iqtidar particularly illuminates the impact of women on Pakistani Islamism, while arguing that these Islamist groups are inadvertently supporting secularization by forcing a critical engagement with the place of religion in public and private life. She highlights the role that competition among Islamists and the focus on the state as the center of their activity plays in assisting secularization.

Hij is absoluut niet de zoon die Goya zich wenste. Javier beschikt niet over het talent en het temperament van zijn vader, hij zit liever met zijn neus in de boeken. Als schilder is Javier maar een flauwe afspiegeling van zijn vader. En ook Goya's obsessieve belangstelling voor vrouwen is hem volledig vreemd.Goya regelt een huwelijk voor Javier en is in de wolken als er een kleinzoon wordt geboren. Javier vermoedt dat zijn eigen vader deze zoon heeft verwekt en wordt gekweld door jaloezie. Na de dood van Goya erft hij al diens bezittingen. Hij besluit de ultieme wraak op zijn vader te nemen met een intrigerende schilderijencyclus, de Zwarte Schilderijen. Het is zijn manier om aan te tonen dat hij een even groot kunstenaar is als zijn vader.;"Jacek Dehnel; Esselien 't Hart";240;2012;Saturnus;history_biography

674725360;eng;3.45;The historian John Lukacs offers a concise history of the twentieth century,,its two world wars and cold war, its nations and leaders. The great themes woven through this spirited narrative are inseparable from the author's own intellectual preoccupations: the fading of liberalism, the rise of populism and nationalism, the achievements and dangers of technology, and the continuing democratization of the globe.The historical twentieth century began with the First World War in 1914 and ended seventy,five years later with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1989. The short century saw the end of European dominance and the rise of American power and influence throughout the world. The twentieth century was an American century,,perhaps theAmerican century. Lukacs explores in detail the phenomenon of national socialism (national socialist parties, he reminds us, have outlived the century), Hitler's sole responsibility for the Second World War, and the crucial roles played by his determined opponents Churchill and Roosevelt. Between 1939 and 1942 Germany came closer to winning than many people suppose.Lukacs casts a hard eye at the consequences of the Second World War,,the often misunderstood Soviet,American cold war,,and at the shifting social and political developments in the Far and Middle East and elsewhere. In an eloquent closing meditation on the passing of the twentieth century, he reflects on the advance of democracy throughout the world and the limitations of human knowledge.;John Lukacs;230;2013;A Short History of the Twentieth Century;history_biography

The book draws on declassified material, such as MI6's Farm Hall transcripts, coded soviet messages cracked by American cryptographers in the Venona project, and interpretations by Russian scholars of documents from the soviet archives.Jim Baggott weaves these threads into a dramatic narrative that spans ten historic years, from the discovery of nuclear fission in 1939 to the aftermath of 'Joe,1,' August 1949's first Soviet atomic bomb test. Why did physicists persist in developing the atomic bomb, despite the devastation that it could bring? Why, despite having a clear head start, did Hitler's physicists fail? Could the soviets have developed the bomb without spies like Klaus Fuchs or Donald Maclean? Did the allies really plot to assassinate a key member of the German bomb program? Did the physicists knowingly inspire the arms race? The First War of Physicsis a grand and frightening story of scientific ambition, intrigue, and genius: a tale barely believable as fiction, which just happens to be historical fact.;Jim Baggott;584;2010;"The First War of Physics: The Secret History of the Atom Bomb; 1939,1949";history_biography

1935149245;eng;4.00;A selection of the Military Book ClubWhile the Civil War is mainly remembered for its epic battles between the Northern and Southern armies, the Union was simultaneously waging another campaign dubbed Anaconda that was gradually depriving the South of industry and commerce, thus rendering the exploits of its field armies moot. When an independent Dixie finally met the dustbin of history, it was the North s coastal campaign, as much as the achievements of its main forces, that was primarily responsible.Strangling the Confederacy examines the various naval actions and land incursions the Union waged from Virginia down the Atlantic Coast and through the Gulf of Mexico to methodically close down every Confederate port that could bring in weapons or supplies. The Rebels responded with fast ships blockade runners that tried to evade the Yankee fleets, while at the same time constructing formidable fortifications that could protect the ports themselves. While Union troopships floated offshore, able to strike anywhere, mobile Confederate forces were kept at hand near crucial points, albeit in smaller numbers, to resist Federal irruptions into their homeland.In the final analysis, the Union s Navy Board, a unique institution at the time, undertook the correct strategy. Its original decision to focus on ten seaports that had rail or water connections with the Confederate interior from Norfolk to Charleston to Mobile to New Orleans shows that the Navy Board understood the concept of decisive points. In a number of battles the Federals were able to leverage their superior technology, including steam power and rifled artillery, in a way that made the Confederate coastal defenses highly vulnerable, if not obsolete. On the other hand, when the Federals encountered Confederate resistance at close,quarters they often experienced difficulties, as in the failures at Fort Fisher, the debacle at Battery Wagner, the Battle of Olustee, and in other clashes.What makes this book particularly unique is its use of modern military doctrine to assess and analyze the campaigns. Kevin Dougherty, an accomplished historian and former career Army officer, concludes that, without knowing it, the Navy Board did an excellent job at following modern strategic doctrine. While the multitude of small battles that flared along the Rebel coast throughout the Civil War have heretofore not been as well known as the more titanic inland battles, in a cumulative sense, Anaconda the most prolonged of the Union campaigns spelled doom for the Confederacy.REVIEWSan excellent short history of the blockade, its campaigns and expeditions, and its successes and failures. It is also an excellent exposition of how the elements of operational design for conducting warfare and their applications have not changed over time. The trick is how to apply them. Dougherty has produced an interesting volume for someone who wants to learn about the Union blockade and for students of the Civil War s grand strategy and operations. It is highly recommended for both.Civil War News, 11/2010For some time there has been a need for a comprehensive analysis of the joint Army,Navy operations conducted by Union forces off the Confederate Atlantic and Gulf coasts. . . . In this volume Kevin Dougherty, a former Army officer . . . examines the role of joint operations through the prism of modern joint,forces doctrine. . . . Evident rivalry and dysfunction between the Union Army and Navy notwithstanding, Dougherty argues that the coastal campaigns constituted a major step in the evolution of joint warfare and planning in U.S. military history .U.S. Naval Institute Proceedingsa dry, witty and ultimately educational account of Union coastal operations against the Confederate ArmyDefence Web, 12/15/2010a very well written overview of the major coastal campaigns conducted during the war.

Instead, it takes a long, judicious view of political change in the Arab world, beginning with the first Awakening in the nineteenth century and extending into future decades when,,if the dream is realized,,a new Arab world defined by pluralism and tolerance will emerge. Marwan Muasher, former foreign minister of Jordan, asserts that all sides,,the United States, Europe, Israel, and Arab governments alike,,were deeply misguided in their thinking about Arab politics and society when the turmoil of the Arab Spring erupted. He explains the causes of the unrest, tracing them back to the first Arab Awakening, and warns of the forces today that threaten the success of the Second Arab Awakening, ignited in December 2010. Hope rests with the new generation and its commitment to tolerance, diversity, the peaceful rotation of power, and inclusive economic growth, Muasher maintains. He calls on the West to rethink political Islam and the Arab,Israeli conflict, and he discusses steps all parties can take to encourage positive state,building in the freshly unsettled Arab world.;Marwan Muasher;232;2014;The Second Arab Awakening: And the Battle for Pluralism;history_biography
195386957;eng;3.54;In the spring of 1676, Nathaniel Bacon, a hotheaded young newcomer to Virginia, led a revolt against the colony's Indian policies. Bacon's Rebellion turned into a civil war within Virginia,,and a war of extermination against the colony's Indian allies,,that lasted into the following winter, sending shock waves throughout the British colonies and into England itself.James Rice offers a colorfully detailed account of the rebellion, revealing how Piscataways, English planters, slave traders, Susquehannocks, colonial officials, plunderers and intriguers were all pulled into an escalating conflict whose outcome, month by month, remained uncertain. In Rice's rich narrative, the lead characters come to life: the powerful, charismatic Governor Berkeley, the sorrowful Susquehannock warrior Monges, the wiley Indian trader and tobacco planter William Byrd, the regal Pamunkey chieftain Cockacoeske, and the rebel leader himself, Nathaniel Bacon. The dark, slender Bacon, born into a prominent family, soon earned a reputation in America as imperious, ambitious, and arrogant. But the colonial leaders did not foresee how rash and headstrong Nathaniel Bacon could be, nor how adept he would prove to be at both inciting colonists and alienating Indians. As the tense drama unfolds, it becomes apparent that the struggle between Governor Berkeley and the impetuous Bacon is nothing less than a battle over the soul of America. Bacon died in the midst of the uprising and Governor Berkeley shortly afterwards, but the profoundly important issues at the heart of the rebellion took another generation to resolve.The late seventeenth century was a pivotal moment in American history, full of upheavals and far,flung conspiracies. Tales From a Revolution brilliantly captures the swirling rumors and central events of Bacon's Rebellion and its aftermath, weaving them into a dramatic tale that is part of the founding story of America.;James D.

Today, the Hebrew city of Tel Aviv glitters white, its Bauhaus,influenced modernist architecture betraying few traces of the city which once stood where it now stands: the Arab city of Jaffa. In this book, Sharon Rotbard blows apart this palimpsest in a clear, fluent and challenging style, which promises to force the reality of what so many have praised as 'progress' into the mainstream discourse. A book that works on many levels, White City, Black City is, all at once, an angry uncovering of a vanished history, a book mourning the loss of an architectural heritage, a careful study in urban design and a beautifully written narrative history. It is in all senses a political book, but one that expands beyond the typical. This book promises to become the central text on Tel Aviv , its publication in Hebrew was hailed as 'path,breaking' and a 'masterpiece'.;Sharon Rotbard;240;2015;"White City; Black City: Architecture and War in Tel Aviv and Jaffa";history_biography

When her peers were focused on feminism, Mitchell was plumbing the depths of her own human condition. When arena rock was king, she turned to jazz. When all others hailed Bob Dylan as a musical messiah, Mitchell saw a fraud burdened with halitosis. Unafraid to write in her own blood, regardless of the cost, Mitchell has been vilified as a diva and embraced as a genius, but rarely has she been recognized as an artist and a thinker.This new portrait of the reclusive icon examines how significant life events ? failed relationships, the surrender of her infant daughter, debilitating sickness ? have influenced her creative expression. Author Katherine Monk captures the rich legacy of her multifaceted subject in this offbeat account, weaving in personal reflections and astute cultural observations, and revealing the Mitchell who remains misunderstood.;Katherine Monk;240;2012;Joni: The Creative Odyssey of Joni Mitchell;history_biography

Seen in historical perspective it was not an especially big massacre: the revolt of the long,subjugated Sicilians might seem just another resistance movement. But the events of 1282 came at a crucial moment. Steven Runciman takes the Vespers as the climax of a great narrative sweep covering the whole of the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century. His sustained narrative power is displayed here with concentrated brilliance in the rise and fall of this fascinating episode. This is also an excellent guide to the historical background to Dante's Divine Comedy, forming almost a Who's Who of the political figures in it, and providing insight into their placement in Hell, Paradise or Purgatory.;Steven Runciman;355;2012;The Sicilian Vespers: A History of the Mediterranean World in the Later Thirteenth Century;history_biography

When Fahim speaks, the story he tells is harrowing, fascinating, and inspiring. Born and raised in Kabul, Fahim saw his country and family torn apart by revolution and civil war. Dodging Afghan authorities and informers with his father and brother, Fahim made his way across the border to Pakistan and then to America.

801447852;eng;3.79;The U.S. government spends enormous resources each year on the gathering and analysis of intelligence, yet the history of American foreign policy is littered with missteps and misunderstandings that have resulted from intelligence failures. In Why Intelligence Fails, Robert Jervis examines the politics and psychology of two of the more spectacular intelligence failures in recent memory: the mistaken belief that the regime of the Shah in Iran was secure and stable in 1978, and the claim that Iraq had active WMD programs in 2002.The Iran case is based on a recently declassified report Jervis was commissioned to undertake by CIA thirty years ago and includes memoranda written by CIA officials in response to Jervis's findings. The Iraq case, also grounded in a review of the intelligence community's performance, is based on close readings of both classified and declassified documents, though Jervis's conclusions are entirely supported by evidence that has been declassified. In both cases, Jervis finds not only that intelligence was badly flawed but also that later explanations,,analysts were bowing to political pressure and telling the White House what it wanted to hear or were willfully blind,,were also incorrect. Proponents of these explanations claimed that initial errors were compounded by groupthink, lack of coordination within the government, and failure to share information. Policy prescriptions, including the recent establishment of a Director of National Intelligence, were supposed to remedy the situation.In Jervis's estimation, neither the explanations nor the prescriptions are adequate. The inferences that intelligence drew were actually quite plausible given the information available. Errors arose, he concludes, from insufficient attention to the ways in which information should be gathered and interpreted, a lack of self,awareness about the factors that led to the judgments, and an organizational culture that failed to probe for weaknesses and explore alternatives. Evaluating the inherent tensions between the methods and aims of intelligence personnel and policymakers from a unique insider's perspective, Jervis forcefully criticizes recent proposals for improving the performance of the intelligence community and discusses ways in which future analysis can be improved.;106828;238;2010;Why Intelligence Fails: Lessons from the Iranian Revolution and the Iraq War;history_biography

He was held in the very same Cairo prison from which his father had been expelled from Egypt to begin a second exile in Budapest when Tamim was only a few months old. Ranging freely back and forth in time between the 1990s and the present day, Barghouti weaves into his account of exile poignant evocations of Palestinian history and daily life , the pleasure of coffee arriving at just the right moment, the challenge of a car journey through the Occupied Territories, the meaning of home and the importance of being able to say, standing in a small village in Palestine, 'I was born here', rather than saying from exile, 'I was born there'. Full of life and humour in the face of a culture of death, I Was Born There, I Was Born Hereis destined, like its predecessor, to become a classic.;16083673;240;2012;"I Was Born There; I Was Born Here";history_biography

807135623;eng;3.88;Until now, scholars have portrayed America's antiwar literature as an outgrowth of World War I, manifested in the works of writers such as Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos. But in War No More, Cynthia Wachtell corrects the record by tracing the steady and inexorable rise of antiwar writing in American literature from the Civil War to the eve of World War I.Beginning with an examination of three very different renderings of the chaotic Battle of Chickamauga ,, a diary entry by a northern infantry officer, a poem romanticizing war authored by a young southerner a few months later, and a gruesome story penned by the veteran Ambrose Bierce ,, Wachtell traces the gradual shift in the late nineteenth century away from highly idealized depictions of the Civil War. Even as the war was under way, she shows, certain writers ,, including Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, John William De Forest, and Nathaniel Hawthorne ,, quietly questioned the meaning and morality of the conflict.As Wachtell demonstrates, antiwar writing made steady gains in public acceptance and popularity in the final years of the nineteenth century and the opening years of the twentieth, especially during the Spanish,American War and the war in the Philippines. While much of the era's war writing continued the long tradition of glorifying battle, works by Bierce, Stephen Crane, Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, William James, and others increasingly presented war as immoral and the modernization and mechanization of combat as something to be deeply feared. Wachtell also explores, through the works of Theodore Roosevelt and others, the resistance that the antiwar impulse met.Drawing upon a wide range of published and unpublished sources, including letters, diaries, essays, poems, short stories, novels, memoirs, speeches, magazine and newspaper articles, and religious tracts, Wachtell makes strikingly clear that pacifism had never been more popular than in the years preceding World War I. War No More concludes by charting the development of antiwar literature from World War I to the present, thus offering the first comprehensive overview of one hundred and fifty years of American antiwar writing.;2899907;233;2010;"War No More: The Antiwar Impulse in American Literature; 1861,1914";history_biography

With clarity as well as a sharp eye for historical detail, Hazard depicts the progressive erosion of the respect for tradition, stability, proportion, and settled usage that had characterized classicism. He shows how a new awareness of the countries beyond Europe encouraged a fresh critical re,evaluation of European institutions and how the growth of modern science and scientific method threatened the accepted intellectual order, while also prompting prosecution of free inquiry.Hazard goes on to consider the situation of the new thinkers who confronted this turbulent world, from Locke, who sought the foundations of reality in sensation and so paved the way for Rousseau, to Bayle, the Huguenot exile whose great dictionary taught Voltaire and his generation that morality could be separated from religion. Throughout, Hazard conveys the excitement of a revolution, the impact of which continues to be felt in our own time.;"48429; 1692; 14050044";454;2013;The Crisis of the European Mind;history_biography

What does it mean to stand for honesty, courage, and charity, especially at times when the culture and the world run counter to those values?Each of the seven biographies represents the life of a man who experienced the struggles and challenges to be strong in the face of forces and circumstances that would have destroyed the resolve of lesser men. Each of the seven men profiled,,George Washington, William Wilberforce, Eric Liddell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jackie Robinson, John Paul II, and Charles Colson,,call the reader to a more elevated walk and lifestyle, one that embodies the gospel in the world around us.;32105;240;2013;7 Men: And the Secret of Their Greatness;history_biography

Drawing on newly analyzed written sources and the growing mass of archaeological finds he presents a very different picture of post,Roman Britain than that usually put forward. In place of the anarchy and mayhem, Rupert suggests that Romanised governmental structures managed to survive the economic collapse of the 5th century and the population collapse of the early sixth century to emerge in new and barbarianism form in the later sixth century. The key figure in this story was Ceawlin, King of Wessex in the 570s. It was he who finally smashed the old order with his ambitious grab for power and who thus opened the way to the creation of the England that we know today with its English culture, English language and English character.;537041;233;2012;Ceawlin: The Man Who Created England;history_biography

It is also about the literary dimensions of the experience itself.

In a narrow medical sense, Down's syndrome is a common disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. It is named after John Langdon Down, the British asylum medical superintendent who described the syndrome as Mongolism in a series of lectures in 1866. In 1959, the disorder was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by the French paediatrician and geneticist Jerome Lejeune and has since been known as Down's Syndrome (in the English,speaking world) or Trisomy 21 (in many European countries). But children and adults born with this chromosomal abnormality have an important collective history beyond their evident importance to the history of medical science. David Wright, a Professor in the History of Medicine at McMaster University, looks at the care and treatment of Down's sufferers , described for much of history as 'idiots', , from Medieval Europe to the present day. The discovery of the genetic basis of the condition and the profound changes in attitudes, care, and early identification of Down's in the genetic era, reflects the fascinating medical and social history of the disorder.;73691;239;2011;Downs: The History of Disability;history_biography

8854134589;ita;4.20;I Pensieri di Marco Aurelio (detti anche Ricordi, Colloqui con se stesso, Ammonizioni) sono un'opera fondamentale per chi voglia accostarsi alla saggezza degli antichi. Una saggezza che non elimina il conflitto fra l'essere e il voler essere, fra i principi filosofici e gl'impulsi naturali, fra la teoria e la pratica. L'imperatore fu un uomo tormentato, in contrasto con quella logica stoica che si sforzava di seguire ma che non riusci a calare pienamente e stabilmente nel suo mondo interiore. I suoi pensieri, infatti, hanno quasi sempre due facce, come una medaglia: un dritto e un rovescio. Cosi, per esempio, crede nella provvidenza ma non esclude del tutto il caos o l'atomismo, confida negli dei ma si domanda perche, , . Dubbi, dunque, non certezze. Ma al di la delle contraddizioni e del pessimismo che si colgono qua e la, spiccano nell'opera due concetti fondamentali e molto significativi: , cioe un gioco dialettico di cui soltanto il saggio e in grado di scoprire il trucco, squarciando il velo dell'illusione, e : una affermazione che, in contrasto con quanto detto in precedenza, costituisce la chiusa e la sintesi dell'opera.;17212;240;2012;L'arte di conoscere se stessi.

Claire is indentured to Wissahickon Farm at the age of 6 in order to receive an education. Claire is an unlikely but highly likable heroine, and the reader joins her on her journey toward adulthood against the alternating backdrops of Philadelphia, a rural farm, and Haiti, as each location becomes almost another character in the story. Claire's story fills a gap in American memory that marginalizes 19th century African American lives. This novel will appeal to readers who love to enter a time and place where they walk alongside characters they get to know as friends. Though Claire's world defines a person by the color of his or her skin, Claire's destiny is to bear witness to the truth that illuminates the color of souls.;7769899;356;2014;Wissahickon Souls;history_biography

After the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1912, Xianyu's father gave his daughter to a Japanese friend who was sympathetic to his efforts to reclaim power. This man raised Xianyu, now known as Kawashima Yoshiko, to restore the Manchus to their former glory. Her fearsome dedication to this cause ultimately got her killed.Yoshiko had a fiery personality and loved the limelight. She shocked Japanese society by dressing in men's clothes and rose to prominence as Commander Jin, touted in Japan's media as a new Joan of Arc. Boasting a short, handsome haircut and a genuine military uniform, Commander Jin was credited with various daring exploits, among them riding horseback as leader of her own army during the Japanese occupation of China.While trying to promote the Manchus, Yoshiko supported the puppet Manchu state established by the Japanese in 1932, which became one of the reasons she was executed for treason after Japan's 1945 defeat. The truth of Yoshiko's life is still a source of contention between China and Japan ,, some believe she was exploited by powerful men, others claim she relished her role as political provocateur. China holds her responsible for unspeakable crimes, while Japan has forgiven her transgressions.

1844676870;eng;4.14;Here is a new, sweeping narrative history of American news media that puts race at the center of the story. From the earliest colonial newspapers to the Internet age, America s racial divisions have played a central role in the creation of the country s media system, just as the media has contributed to and every so often, combated racial oppression. News for All the People reveals how racial segregation distorted the information Americans received from the mainstream media. It unearths numerous examples of how publishers and broadcasters actually fomented racial violence and discrimination through their coverage. And it chronicles the influence federal media policies exerted in such conflicts. It depicts the struggle of Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American journalists who fought to create a vibrant yet little,known alternative, democratic press, and then, beginning in the 1970s, forced open the doors of the major media companies.The writing is fast,paced, story,driven, and replete with memorable portraits of individual journalists and media executives, both famous and obscure, heroes and villains. It weaves back and forth between the corporate and government leaders who built our segregated media system such as Herbert Hoover, whose Federal Radio Commission eagerly awarded a license to a notorious Ku Klux Klan organization in the nation s capital and those who rebelled against that system, like Pittsburgh Courier publisher Robert L. Vann, who led a remarkable national campaign to get the black,face comedy Amos n Andy off the air.Based on years of original archival research and up,to,the,minute reporting and written by two veteran journalists and leading advocates for a more inclusive and democratic media system, News for All the People should become the standard history of American media.;"13913; 4809362";453;2011;News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media;history_biography

Here the birds are slightly more exotic, slightly more confiding, the grass greener and the fruit sweeter. To know such a place, to love such a place, is part of being human.Sometimes it s a place of myth, like the Garden of Eden. Sometimes it exists in fictional form, like Narnia or Shangri,La. Sometimes it comes in memories of a golden day in childhood, or in a glorious, doomed love affair.

A place where you leave a small piece of your heart and return as often as you can so as not to lose it. It s a place of privilege.Simon Barnes found such a place when he woke in his first morning in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia to find elephants eating the roof of his hut. It was a homecoming, and he has been faithful to that passion ever since. Here he has known peace, danger, discomfort, fear and a profound sense of oneness with the Valley, with all nature and with the world.

Answers to basic questions about who ended slavery, how, and why remain fiercely contested more than a century and a half after the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. In The Long Emancipation, Ira Berlin draws upon decades of study to offer a framework for understanding slavery's demise in the United States. Freedom was not achieved in a moment, and emancipation was not an occasion but a near,century,long process,,a shifting but persistent struggle that involved thousands of men and women.Berlin teases out the distinct characteristics of emancipation, weaving them into a larger narrative of the meaning of American freedom. The most important factor was the will to survive and the enduring resistance of enslaved black people themselves. In striving for emancipation, they were also the first to raise the crucial question of their future status. If they were no longer slaves, what would they be? African Americans provided the answer, drawing on ideals articulated in the Declaration of Independence and precepts of evangelical Christianity. Freedom was their inalienable right in a post,slavery society, for nothing seemed more natural to people of color than the idea that all Americans should be equal.African Americans were not naive about the price of their idealism. Just as slavery was an institution initiated and maintained by violence, undoing slavery also required violence.

Now reaching its four hundredth anniversary, it remains one of the most frequently used Bibles in the English,speaking world, especially in America.Lavishly illustrated with reproductions from early editions of the KJB, Bible: The Story of the King James Versionoffers a vivid and authoritative history of this renowned translation, ranging from the Bible's inception to the present day. Gordon Campbell, a leading authority on Renaissance literatures, tells the engaging and complex story of how this translation came to be commissioned, who the translators were, and how the translation was accomplished. Campbell does not end with the printing of that first edition, but also traces the textual history from 1611 to the establishment of the modern text by Oxford University Press in 1769, shedding light on the subsequent generations who edited and interacted with the text and bringing to life the controversies surrounding later revisions. In addition, the author examines the reception of the King James Version, showing how its popularity has shifted through time and territory, ranging from adulation to deprecation and attracting the attention of a wide variety of adherents. Since the KJB is more widely read in America today than in any other country, Campbell pays particular attention to the history of the KJB in the United States.

Also departing from New York that day,,and heading in the opposite direction by train , was a young journalist from The Cosmopolitan magazine, Elizabeth Bisland. Each woman was determined to outdo Jules Verne's fictional hero Phileas Fogg and circle the globe in less than eighty days. The dramatic race that ensued would span twenty,eight thousand miles, captivate the nation, and change both competitors' lives forever.The two women were a study in contrasts. Nellie Bly was a scrappy, hard,driving, ambitious reporter from Pennsylvania coal country who sought out the most sensational news stories, often going undercover to expose social injustice. Genteel and elegant, Elizabeth Bisland had been born into an aristocratic Southern family, preferred novels and poetry to newspapers, and was widely referred to as the most beautiful woman in metropolitan journalism. Both women, though, were talented writers who had carved out successful careers in the hypercompetitive, male,dominated world of big,city newspapers. Eighty Days brings these trailblazing women to life as they race against time and each other, unaided and alone, ever aware that the slightest delay could mean the difference between victory and defeat.A vivid real,life re,creation of the race and its aftermath, from its frenzied start to the nail,biting dash at its finish, Eighty Days is history with the heart of a great adventure novel.

Along the way, we are treated to fascinating glimpses of everyday life in the late nineteenth century , an era of unprecedented technological advances, newly remade in the image of the steamship, the railroad, and the telegraph. For Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland , two women ahead of their time in every sense of the word,,were not only racing around the world.

1408844397;eng;4.42;David Kynaston's history of post,war Britain has so far taken us from the radically reforming Labour governments of the late 1940s in Austerity Britain, through the growing prosperity of Family Britain's more placid 1950s, to the very cusp of the 1960s and the coming of a new Zeitgeist in Modernity Britain. The first part, Opening the Box, 1957,59, plotted the main themes of the new spirit of the age. Now, in part two , A Shake of the Dice, 1959,62, through a rich haul of diaries, letters, newspapers and many other sources, Kynaston gets up close to a turbulent era as the speed of social change accelerated.By 1959 consumerism was inexorably taking hold (stripes for Signal toothpaste, flavours for potato crisps), relative economic decline was becoming the staple of political discourse (entry into Europe increasingly seen as our salvation), immigration was turning into an ever,hotter issue (the controversial coming of controls), traditional norms of morality were perceived as under serious threat (Lady Chatterley's Loverfreely on sale after the famous case), and traditional working,class culture was changing (wakes weeks in decline, the end of the maximum wage for footballers) even as Coronation Streetestablished itself as a national institution. The greatest shake of the dice, though, concerned urban redevelopment: city centres were being yanked into the age of the motor car, slum clearance was intensified, and the skyline became studded with brutalist high,rise boxes. Some of this transformation was necessary, but too much would destroy communities and leave a harsh, fateful legacy.This profoundly important story of the period of transformation from the old to the brink of a new world is now told brilliantly and in full for the first time.;99424;454;2014;"Modernity Britain: A Shake of the Dice; 1959,62";history_biography

The investigation proceeds in case,study fashion using the principal surviving witnesses, beginning with the communities of Pliny & Tacitus (with a look at Pliny's teacher, Quintilian) from the time of the emperor Trajan. Johnson then moves on to explore elite reading during the era of the Antonines, including the medical community around Galen, the philological community around Gellius & Fronto (with a look at the curious reading habits of Fronto's pupil Marcus Aurelius), & the intellectual communities lampooned by the satirist Lucian. Along the way, evidence from the papyri is deployed to help to understand better & more concretely both the mechanics of reading, & the social interactions that surrounded the ancient book. The result is a rich cultural history of individual reading communities that differentiate themselves in interesting ways even while in aggregate showing a coherent reading culture with fascinating similarities & contrasts to the reading culture of today.;267350;237;2010;Readers & Reading Culture in the High Roman Empire: A Study of Elite Communities;history_biography

300169493;eng;3.89;Rising to a triumphant height of 630 feet, the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is a revered monument to America's western expansion. Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid,1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay.Campbell dispels long,held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize,winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision.
