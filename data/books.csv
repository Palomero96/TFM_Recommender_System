This essential tome includes three stories of battle written by Ennis and illustrated by Tomas Aira including: Castles in the Sky: A horrifying tale of early bomber pilots and their incredibly difficult missions during wartime. Thrust into the sky with a new team of soldiers these brave men learn quickly the horrors of aerial combat over the skies of Germany. Children of Israel: In 1973, the Golan Heights was the home to the most brutal tank warfare in history. As a young nation of Israel faced the imposing forces of the Syrian army, the true mettle of these soldiers would be tested as never before.

But the realities of battle are dreadful to behold, and what the little family find waiting for them is deadlier than any mythical dragon.

Paul Wilson's engaging, self-employed, off-the-books fixer, Repairman Jack, returns for another intense, action-packed adventure just a little over the border into the weird, in The Haunted Air.

Repairman Jack is a wonderful character, ultracompetent but still vulnerable. Wilson strolls into X-Files territory and makes it his own, keeping the action brisk and the level of suspense steadily rising, said the San Francisco Examiner & Chronicle.In Astoria, Queens, the lively ethnic neighborhood just across the river from Manhattan, a house is being haunted by the ghost of a nine-year-old girl in riding clothes. More than two decades before, she'd been abducted from stables in Brooklyn. Now it's up to Jack to uncover the truth of her story and liberate the pretty, blond spirit. Perhaps the answer is in the odd little store called the Shurio Coppe? Ah, but that would be telling.Jack does things no human being should be able to do, but we watch, in horrified fascination, as the forces of evil seem about to triumph and fill the world with eternal darkness. And then-- but you must read the book.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.;F.

299250245;eng;3,23;From bloodthirsty conquest to exotic romance, stereotypes of Spain abound. This new volume by distinguished historian Stanley G. Payne draws on his half-century of experience to offer a balanced, broadly chronological survey of Spanish history from the Visigoths to the present. Who were the first Spaniards? Is Spain a fully Western country? Was Spanish liberalism a failure? Examining Spain's unique role in the larger history of Western Europe, Payne reinterprets key aspects of the country's history.Topics include Muslim culture in the peninsula, the Spanish monarchy, the empire, and the relationship between Spain and Portugal. Turning to the twentieth century, Payne discusses the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War. The book's final chapters focus on the Franco regime, the nature of Spanish fascism, and the special role of the military. Analyzing the figure of Franco himself, Payne seeks to explain why some Spaniards still regard him with respect, while many others view the late dictator with profound loathing.Framed by reflections on the author's own formation as a Hispanist and his evaluation of the controversy about historical memory in contemporary Spain, this volume offers deeply informed insights into both the history and the historiography of a unique country.AChoice Outstanding Academic BookBest Books for General Audiences, selected by the Public Library Association;Stanley G.

Its principles can be found in our Bill of Rights and in the Constitution. But what was this strange document that dwells on tax relief and greater fishing rights, and how did it gain legendary status?Dan Jones takes us back to 1215, the turbulent year when the Magna Carta was just a peace treaty between England's King John and a group of self-interested, violent barons who were tired of his high taxes and endless foreign wars.

1612001033;eng;3,6;After the publication of his bestselling novel Catch-22, Joseph Heller usually chose to deny that any of his richly drawn characters were based on his actual war mates. However, to those who served with Heller in the 340th Bomb Group the novel's characters were indeed recognizable - the hard-drinking, vengeful, and disillusioned Chief White Half Oat, young, sliced-in-half Kid Sampson, shrieking, frenzied Hungry Joe, Colonel Cathcart, General Dreedle, Yossarian and that capitalist supreme, Milo Minderbinder.In this book, written and colorfully illustrated by the daughter of the 340th Bomb Group's ,nder, Colonel Willis Chapman, we finally encounter the real men and combat missions on which the novel was based. While Heller's fully developed characters stand solely, solidly and uniquely on their own merits, 'The True Story of Catch-22' proves that any resemblance to persons living or dead is, in fact, actual. This three-part book blends fact, fancy, and history with full-blown original illustrations and rare, previously unpublished photos of these daring USAAF flyers and their Corsican-based B-25 Mitchell medium bombers.Along with descriptions of the 340th's real wartime events, the work includes twelve men of the Bomb Group relating twelve richly told tales of their own. Now all of the men upon whom Heller based his characters are gone. However, the last survivor, George L. Wells, was an extraordinary combat pilot who tied the record for the number of bombing missions flown in WWII with 102.George, the model for Catch-22's Capt. Wren, is the common thread who weaves through this book, allowing the reader to truly feel the war and even thumb through George's well-worn mission book describing attacks on Axis ports, ships, bridges, and the notorious Brenner Pass.In this book the reader will discover that truth is indeed as fascinating as fiction! Author Patricia Chapman Meder has been a professional artist in both fine and commercial art for the past 35 years, 13 of them in Europe. When Catch-22 was published it was quickly apparent that this book was based on the Bomb Group her father ,nded in World War II. This true-life parallel book thus begged to be written. Pat Meder has also written a full-color companion work to The True Story of Catch-22, containing her delightful original artwork and caricatures of the individuals, The True Story of Catch-22 Illustrated.REVIEWS --- Heller's satiric caricatures are here shown to have stemmed from patriotic, courageous, highly decorated airmen who daily performed heroic wartime feats against overwhelming obstacles. The log of George Wells (Captain Wren in Catch-22), who flew a record 102 missions in his B-25, is included in an appendix.Library Journal...uses rare and unpublished photos to bring our actual heroes to life through use of first person narrative...Fans of Catch-22 will enjoy the book.

All but forgotten by history, a young Karstens arrived in the Yukon during the 1897 Gold Rush, gained fame as a dog musher hauling U.S. Mail in Alaska, and eventually became the first superintendent of Mount McKinley National Park (now known as Denali National Park and Preserve). Aided by Karstens's own journals, longtime Denali writer and photographer Tom Walker uncovered archival information about the Stuck climb, and reveals that the Stuck triumph was an expedition marred by significant conflict. Without Karstens's wilderness skills and Alaska-honed tenacity, it is quite possible Hudson Stuck would never have climbed anywhere near the summit of McKinley. Yet the two men had a falling out shortly after the climb and never spoke again. In this book, Walker attempts to set the record straight about the historic first ascent itself, as well as other pioneer attempts by Frederick Cook and Judge Wickersham.Fans of Alaska literature, American history, and mountaineering lore will love this adventurous biography of the largerthan-life sourdough Karstens, in which Alaska--its wilderness, its iconic mountain, and its pioneer spirit--looms large.;Tom Walker;304;2013;The Seventymile Kid: The Lost Legacy of Harry Karstens and the First Ascent of Mount McKinley;history_biography

The fully articulated skeleton of a female saint, dressed in an intricate costume of silk brocade and gold lace, withered fingers glittering with colorful rubies, emeralds, and pearls this is only one of the specially photographed relics featured in Heavenly Bodies. In 1578 news came of the discovery in Rome of a labyrinth of underground tombs, which were thought to hold the remains of thousands of early Christian martyrs. Skeletons of these supposed saints were subsequently sent to Catholic churches and religious houses in German-speaking Europe to replace holy relics that had been destroyed in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. The skeletons, known as the catacomb saints, were carefully reassembled, richly dressed in fantastic costumes, wigs, crowns, jewels, and armor, and posed in elaborate displays inside churches and shrines as reminders to the faithful of the heavenly treasures that awaited them after death. Paul Koudounaris gained unprecedented access to religious institutions to reveal these fascinating historical artifacts.

Murphy follows each would-be assassin and the repercussions of their actions, illuminating daily life in Victorian England, the development of the monarchy under Queen Victoria and the evolution of the attacks in light of evolving social issues and technology.There was Edward Oxford, a bartender who dreamed of becoming an admiral, who was simply shocked when his attempt to shoot the pregnant Queen and Prince consort made him a madman in the world's eyes. There was hunchbacked John Bean, who dreamed of historical notoriety in a publicized treason trial, and William Hamilton, forever scarred by the ravages of the Irish Potato Famine. Roderick MacLean enabled Victoria to successfully strike insanity pleas from Britain's legal process. Most threatening of all were the dynamitards who targeted her Majesty's Golden Jubilee--who signaled the advent of modern terrorism with their publicly focused attack.From these cloak-and-dagger plots to Victoria's brilliant wit and steadfast courage, Shooting Victoriais historical narrative at its most thrilling, complete with astute insight into how these attacks actually revitalized the British crown at a time when monarchy was quickly becoming unpopular abroad. While thrones across Europe toppled, the Queen's would-be assassins contributed greatly to the preservation of the monarchy and to the stability that it enjoys today.

300179030;eng;3,93;For decades after 1945, it was generally believed that the German army, professional and morally decent, had largely stood apart from the SS, Gestapo, and other corps of the Nazi machine. Ben Shepherd draws on a wealth of primary sources and recent scholarship to convey a much darker, more complex picture. For the first time, the German army is examined throughout the Second World War, across all combat theaters and occupied regions, and from multiple perspectives: its battle performance, social composition, relationship with the Nazi state, and involvement in war crimes and military occupation.This was a true people's army, drawn from across German society and reflecting that society as it existed under the Nazis. Without the army and its conquests abroad, Shepherd explains, the Nazi regime could not have perpetrated its crimes against Jews, prisoners of war, and civilians in occupied countries. The author examines how the army was complicit in these crimes and why some soldiers, units, and higher ,nds were more complicit than others. Shepherd also reveals the reasons for the army's early battlefield successes and its mounting defeats up to 1945, the latter due not only to Allied superiority and Hitler's mismanagement as ,nder-in-chief, but also to the failings--moral, political, economic, strategic, and operational--of the army's own leadership.;Ben H.

1941393233;eng;3,36;A moving, compelling memoir about growing up and escaping the tragic legacy of mental illness, suicide, addiction, and depression in one of America's most famous families: the Hemingways.She opens her eyes. The room is dark. She hears yelling, smashed plates, and wishes it was all a terrible dream. But it isn't. This is what it was like growing up as a Hemingway. In this deeply moving, searingly honest new memoir, actress and mental health icon Mariel Hemingway shares in candid detail the story of her troubled childhood in a famous family haunted by depression, alcoholism, illness, and suicide. Born just a few months after her grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, shot himself, it was Mariel's mission as a girl to escape the desperate cycles of severe mental health issues that had plagued generations of her family.Surrounded by a family tortured by alcoholism (both parents), depression (her sister Margaux), suicide (her grandfather and four other members of her family), schizophrenia (her sister Muffet), and cancer (mother), it was all the young Mariel could do to keep her head. In a compassionate voice she reveals her painful struggle to stay sane as the youngest child in her family, and how she coped with the chaos by becoming OCD and obsessive about her food, schedule, and organization.The twisted legacy of her family has never quite let go of Mariel, but now in this memoir she opens up about her claustrophobic marriage, her acting career, and turning to spiritual healers and charlatans for solace. Ultimately Mariel has written a story of triumph about learning to overcome her family's demons and developing love and deep compassion for them. At last, in this memoir she can finally tell the true story of the tragedies and troubles of the Hemingway family, and she delivers a book that beckons comparisons with Mary Karr and Jeanette Walls.;Mariel Hemingway, Ben Greenman;288;2015;Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family;history_biography
307956458;eng;3,67;Duel with the Devilis acclaimed historian Paul Collins' remarkable true account of a stunning turn-of-the-19th century murder and the trial that ensued - a showdown in which iconic political rivals Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr joined forces to make sure justice was done. Still our nation's longest running cold case, the mystery of Elma Sands finally comes to a close with this book, which delivers the first substantial break in the case in over 200 years.In the closing days of 1799, the United States was still a young republic. Waging a fierce battle for its uncertain future were two political parties: the well-moneyed Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the populist Republicans, led by Aaron Burr. The two finest lawyers in New York, Burr and Hamilton were bitter rivals both in and out of the courtroom, and as the next election approached--with Manhattan likely to be the swing district on which the presidency would hinge--their animosity reached a crescendo. Central to their dispute was the Manhattan water supply, which Burr saw not just as an opportunity to help a city devastated by epidemics but as a chance to heal his battered finances.But everything changed when Elma Sands, a beautiful young Quaker woman, was found dead in Burr's newly constructed Manhattan Well. The horrific crime quickly gripped the nation, and before long accusations settled on one of Elma's suitors, handsome young carpenter Levi Weeks. As the enraged city demanded a noose be draped around the accused murderer's neck, the only question seemed to be whether Levi would make it to trial or be lynched first.The young man's only hope was to hire a legal dream team. And thus it was that New York's most bitter political rivals and greatest attorneys did the unthinkable--they teamed up.At once an absorbing legal thriller and an expertly crafted portrait of the United States in the time of the Founding Fathers, Duel with the Devilis a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction.;Paul  Collins;304;2013;Duel with the Devil: The True Story of How Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr Teamed Up to Take on America's First Sensational Murder Mystery;history_biography

Their task was to document the activity of an al Qaeda leader rumored to be very close to Bin Laden with a small army in a Taliban stronghold. Five days later, only one of those Navy SEALS made it out alive.This is the story of the only survivor of Operation Redwing, SEAL fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, and the extraordinary firefight that led to the largest loss of life in American Navy SEAL history. His squadmates fought valiantly beside him until he was the only one left alive, blasted by an RPG into a place where his pursuers could not find him. Over the next four days, terribly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell crawled for miles through the mountains and was taken in by sympathetic villagers who risked their lives to keep him safe from surrounding Taliban warriors.A born and raised Texan, Marcus Luttrell takes us from the rigors of SEAL training, where he and his fellow SEALs discovered what it took to join the most elite of the American special forces, to a fight in the desolate hills of Afghanistan for which they never could have been prepared. His account of his squadmates' heroism and mutual support renders an experience that is both heartrending and life-affirming.

For five long years, thousands of men and women fought ferociously in the coldest corner of hell on earth. Some fought for survival, some struggled to help others survive, and some sought to crush their enemies. If man-made death didn't get you, the Arctic's weapons of ice and cold would. These natural weapons killed regardless of whose side you were on or how just was your cause. No one escaped unscathed. Author Mike Walling captures the Arctic convoys' bitter essence in Forgotten Sacrifice.The story launches in October 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union began diplomatic maneuvering. The action accelerates with Winston Churchill's decision in 1941 to provide supplies to Soviet forces battling the German invasion. From this point until the closing days of WWII in spring 1945, an unremitting sea battle raged within the confines of the always-lethal, ever-shifting Arctic ice pack and the savage Scandinavian coastline. Nearly 4.5 million tons of supplies were moved in 77 convoys over the course of 5 years in order to help the Soviet war effort. The Allies fought to keep the sea lanes open to Murmansk while the Germans were determined to slaughter every ship which dared to make the attempt. By the end of the convoys, 98 ships had been lost.

For all appearances, Paul Ogorzow was a model German. An employed family man, party member, and sergeant in the infamous Brownshirts, he had worked his way up in the Berlin railroad from a manual laborer laying track to assistant signalman. But he also had a secret need to harass and frighten women. Then he was given a gift from the Nazi high ,nd.Due to Allied bombing raids, a total blackout was instituted throughout Berlin, including on the commuter trains--trains often used by women riding home alone from the factories.Under cover of darkness and with a helpless flock of victims to choose from, Ogorzow's depredations grew more and more horrific. He escalated from simply frightening women to physically attacking them, eventually raping and murdering them. Beginning in September 1940, he started casually tossing their bodies off the moving train. Though the Nazi party tried to censor news of the attacks, the women of Berlin soon lived in a state of constant fear.It was up to Wilhelm Ludtke, head of the Berlin police's serious crimes division, to hunt down the madman in their midst.

1612194192;eng;4,17;Before there was money, there was debtEvery economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems--to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There's not a shred of evidence to support it.Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods--that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like guilt, sin, and redemption) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history--as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.;David Graeber;566;2014;Debt: The First 5,000 Years;history_biography

Phoenix Coyotes brawler Paul Bisonette said I'm not really afraid of anyone, but if I were to fight him, I'd probably be shaking going in. Ask Laraque, though, and he'd say that's not who he is. Known as a player who was unfailingly respectful and gentlemanly even when he was going toe-to-toe with the toughest guys in the toughest league in the world, today Laraque takes that courageous sense of what is fair into fights that are much more important than the outcome of a hockey game. The son of Haitian immigrants, Laraque campaigns for World Vision to help with Haitian relief. A committed believer in animal rights (and probably the toughest vegan in the world), Laraque is a spokesperson for PETA. A conscientious environmentalist, Laraque stepped up to be the deputy leader of the Green Party. In this intimate, often surprising, biography, Laraque tells the story of a hockey player's life that is unlike any other, from a childhood facing racism in Quebec's minor hockey system, to the thrill of the Stanley Cup Finals as an Edmonton Oiler, and sharing a dressing room with Sidney Crosby--and from dropping the gloves on the ice to refusing to back back down from much more serious fights off the ice.

More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon's vast operations. But in an eye-opening account, Base Nationshows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills--and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine's accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy.

For the first time, Baxter is ready to share her incredible highs, (working with Robert Redford, Doris Day, Lana Turner, and the cast of Family Ties), and lows (a thorny relationship with her mother, a difficult marriage to David Birney, a bout with breast cancer), finally revealing the woman behind the image.From her childhood in Hollywood, growing up the daughter of actress and co-creator of One Day at a TimeWhitney Blake, Baxter became familiar with the ups and downs of show business from an early age. After wholeheartedly embracing the 60s counterculture lifestyle, she was forced to rely on her acting skills after her first divorce left her a 22-year-old single mother of two. Baxter began her professional career with supporting roles in the critically panned horror film Ben, and in the political thriller All the President's Men.More lucrative work soon followed on the small screen. Baxter starred with actor David Birney as the title characters in controversial sitcom Bridget Loves Bernie. While the series only lasted a year, her high-profile romance with Birney lasted 15 volatile and unhappy years. Hiding the worst of her situation from even those closest to her, Baxter's career flourished as her self-esteem and family crumbled. Her successful run as Nancy on Familywas followed by her enormously popular role on Family Ties, and dozens of well-received television movies.After a bitter divorce and custody battle with Birney, Baxter increasingly relied on alcohol as a refuge, and here speaks candidly of her decision to take her last drink in 1990.And while another ruinous divorce to screenwriter Michael Blodgett taxed Baxter's strength and confidence, she has emerged from her experiences with the renewed self-assurance, poise, and understanding that have enabled her to find a loving, respectful relationship with Nancy Locke, and to speak about it openly.Told with insight, wit, and disarming frankness, Untiedis the eye-opening and inspiring life of an actress, a woman, and a mother who has come into her own.;Meredith Baxter;304;2011;Untied: A Memoir of Family, Fame, and Floundering;history_biography

The winter of 1863 had rung down a white curtain on the desperate struggle for North America. The United States and Great Britain had fought each other to a bitter draw. On both sides of the Atlantic the forges of war glowed as they poured out the new technologies of war. British and French aid transformed the ragged Confederate armies and filled them with new confidence. Both sides strained to be ready for the coming campaign season. Both sides seek to anticipate each other.The British strike suddenly at Hooker's strung out army in winter quarters in upstate New York in a brutal swirling late battle across frozen fields and streams. Besieged Portland shudders relentless assault. The French attack Fort Hudson on the Mississippi. At Lincoln's direction, two great raids are launched at the United Kingdom itself as Russia enters the war on the side of the Union to raid the Irish Sea. These are only preliminaries to the great gathering of modernized armies and ironclad fleets and with them are deadly submersibles and balloons. Battle rages from Maine to northern Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay, down to steamy Louisiana. And far away across the sea Dublin stands siege as Russia cast eyes upon Constantinople. For Americans, blue and gray, Britons, Irish, Frenchmen, and Russians, the summer of 1864 is the crescendo battle of destinies and dreams.;Peter G.

1596915331;eng;4,49;David Wojnarowicz was an abused child, a teen runaway who barely finished high school, but he emerged as one of the most important voices of his generation. He found his tribe in New York's East Village, a neighborhood noted in the 1970s and '80s for drugs, blight, and a burgeoning art scene. His creativity spilled out in paintings, photographs, films, texts, installations, and in his life and its recounting-creating a sort of mythos around himself. His circle of East Village artists moved into the national spotlight just as the AIDS plague began its devastating advance, and as right-wing culture warriors reared their heads. As Wojnarowicz's reputation as an artist grew, so did his reputation as an agitator-because he dealt so openly with his homosexuality, so angrily with his circumstances as a Person With AIDS, and so fiercely with his would-be censors.Fire in the Bellyis the untold story of a polarizing figure at a pivotal moment in American culture-and one of the most highly acclaimed biographies of the year.;Cynthia Carr;624;2012;Fire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz;history_biography
080145364X;eng;3,67;Limited time offer: Through special arrangement with University Press of New England, we are pleased to offer a specially priced two-book set of Unbuttoning America and Peyton Place for just $29.95 paperback.Published in 1956, Peyton Place became a bestseller and a literary phenomenon. A lurid and gripping story of murder, incest, female desire, and social injustice, it was consumed as avidly by readers as it was condemned by critics and the clergy. Its author, Grace Metalious, a housewife who grew up in poverty in a New Hampshire mill town and had aspired to be a writer from childhood, loosely based the novel's setting, characters, and incidents on real-life places, people, and events. The novel sold more than 30 million copies in hardcover and paperback, and it was adapted into a hit Hollywood film in 1957 and a popular television series that aired from 1964 to 1969. More than half a century later, the term Peyton Place is still in circulation as a code for a community harboring sordid secrets.In Unbuttoning America, Ardis Cameron mines extensive interviews, fan letters, and archival materials including contemporary cartoons and cover images from film posters and foreign editions to tell how the story of a patricide in a small New England village circulated over time and became a cultural phenomenon. She argues that Peyton Place, with its frank discussions of poverty, sexuality, class and ethnic discrimination, and small-town hypocrisy, was more than a tawdry potboiler. Metalious s depiction of how her three central female characters come to terms with their identity as women and sexual beings anticipated second-wave feminism. More broadly, Cameron asserts, the novel was also part of a larger postwar struggle over belonging and recognition. Fictionalizing contemporary realities, Metalious pushed to the surface the hidden talk and secret rebellions of a generation no longer willing to ignore the disparities and domestic constraints of Cold War America.;Ardis Cameron;223;2015;Unbuttoning America: A Biography of Peyton Place;history_biography

1632862794;eng;3,63;The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008.Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.;Michael Witwer;302;2015;Empire of Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons;history_biography

But Delphine Duplessi sees more than most. At a time in her career when she could easily be unknown and penniless, like so many of her classmates from L'Ecole de Beaux Arts, in America she has gained notoriety for her stunning shadow portraits that frequently expose her subjects' most scandalous secrets--for better or for worse.

When Philip Marsden moved to a remote creekside farmhouse in Cornwall, the intensity of his response took him aback. It led him to begin exploring these questions, prompting a journey westwards to Land's End through one of the most fascinating regions of Europe.From the Neolithic ritual landscape of Bodmin Moor to the Arthurian traditions of Tintagel, from the mysterious china-clay country to the granite tors and tombs of the far south-west, Marsden assembles a chronology of our shifting attitudes to place. In archives, he uncovers the life and work of other 'topophiles' before him - medieval chroniclers and Tudor topographers, eighteenth-century eighteenth-century antiquarians, post-industrial poets and abstract painters. Drawing also on his own travels overseas, Marsden reveals that the shape of the land lies not just at the heart of our history but of man's perennial struggle to belong on this earth.;Philip Marsden;348;2014;Rising Ground: A Search for the Spirit of Place;history_biography

521590620;eng;4;The Living Text of the Gospelsrepresents an important new departure in Gospel studies and textual criticism. David Parker offers a way of reading the Gospels which treats seriously the fact that they first existed as manuscripts. Through an analysis of the different forms of a number of key passages, he demonstrates that the Gospels cannot be properly understood as texts without taking into consideration their physical existence as manuscripts, printed books and electronic text. In conclusion, he argues that the search for an original text of the Gospels overlooks the way in which the early church passed down its traditions. It is an approach that challenges many of the assumptions of New Testament scholarship. But, at the same time, it does not assume any prior knowledge of the discipline, and can therefore be used as a unique alternative to traditional primers of New Testament textual criticism.;D.C.

Paul Wilson's engaging, self-employed, off-the-books fixer, Repairman Jack, returns for another intense, action-packed adventure just a little over the border into the weird, in The Haunted Air. First introduced years ago in the bestseller The Tomb, Jack has been the hero of a series of exciting novels set in and around New York City including Legacies, Conspiracies, All the Rage, and Hosts. Repairman Jack is a wonderful character, ultracompetent but still vulnerable. Wilson strolls into X-Files territory and makes it his own, keeping the action brisk and the level of suspense steadily rising, said the San Francisco Examiner & Chronicle.In Astoria, Queens, the lively ethnic neighborhood just across the river from Manhattan, a house is being haunted by the ghost of a nine-year-old girl in riding clothes. More than two decades before, she'd been abducted from stables in Brooklyn. Now it's up to Jack to uncover the truth of her story and liberate the pretty, blond spirit. Perhaps the answer is in the odd little store called the Shurio Coppe? Ah, but that would be telling.Jack does things no human being should be able to do, but we watch, in horrified fascination, as the forces of evil seem about to triumph and fill the world with eternal darkness.

Los Angeles Police Detective Ed Browning intended to write off the death of actor Leslie Clover as an accident until Maisy said she could prove the man was murdered. To top that off, she bet him she could solve the murder before he could. Browning took the bet and the contest was on to catch a killer. Browning only had a bunch of inexperienced, clumsy, bungling cops to help him, while Maisy had the aid of silent screen actress and comedy queen Mabel Normand. The detective and the actress went to the wire nose-to-nose in their race to solve the crime and needed a photo finish to determine the winner.I very much liked the historical flavor that was brought to the story, both the period and the place were well drawn. Of course, that is what we expect from a Larry Names book. I was impressed with the level of detection that Maisy brings to the story. Most current mysteries are about the characters, the setting and the action. What gets left out of that equation is unraveling clues.

It was in Les Chants de Maldororthat Andre Breton discovered the phrase that would come to represent the Surrealist doctrine of objective chance: as beautiful as the random encounter between an umbrella and a sewing-machine upon a dissecting-table. Artists inspired by Lautreamont include Man Ray, Rene Magritte, Max Ernst, Andre Masson, Yves Tanguy and, in particular, Salvador Dali, who in 1933 produced an entire series of illustrations for Les Chants de Maldoror. Twenty of those illustrations are included, for the first time, in this new, definitive edition of Lautreamont's influential masterpiece. Vividly translated by R. J. Dent the first new translation for over thirty years--this edition also includes a foreword by French Surrealist poet Paul Eluard and a concise biography of the author by poet Jeremy Reed.

Each new volume by Stuart Ross is a more confounding grab bag than the last. In YOU EXIST. DETAILS FOLLOW., his seventh full- length collection of poetry, Stuart Ross veers in opposite directions: narrative confessionalism poems, and works that might be considered abstract expressionist, and a lot both in between and beyond those boundaries. Still, each poem breathes with the signature weirdness, the sharp wit and gentle awe that Ross is known for. Here you'll find poems from Ross's ongoing auto-biographical Razovsky series, one-line poems, centos, fractured sonnets, poems composed through surrealist strategies, and more.Ross's absurdism doesn't rely on unconnected sentences, abstract thought, or an unusual, elevated vocabulary: rather, his poetry delights in the silliness of concrete mundanity. The collection thus begins by launching us into a happily disjointed mind, into images connected as though by sparking, duct-taped wires, buzzing weird electrical fires of thought. Matrix MagazineA voice all his own. Stuart Ross unleashes his refreshing snark in his latest collection of poems He runs the gamut from his own brand of absurdist expressionism to fond childhood memories and poetic confessions. Ross wisely and parenthetically writes: (Tension is a good thing sometimes. For example, you should stick it in art.) Stuart Ross loves that tension, fortunately for his readers. UptownI personally believe Stuart Ross may be Canada's most important poet Ross could be called a 'narrative surrealist' but that, like most labels, does not adequately capture the gymnastic feats of construction he employs. At his best Ross combines images and emotions with the same alacrity of a Max Ernst or Salvador Dali. The literal is a sheer curtain that surrealists drape like a fabric or a fold in time. Ross gives a master class in almost every poem in the delicate art of balancing truth from fiction, what we imagine from what we know to be real For me, there is no poet as entertaining as Stuart Ross and very few as smart.

Written in the late years of the emperor Augustus, and cut short when the emperor sent the poet into exile, the poem's tone ranges from tragedy to farce, and its subject matter from astronomy and obscure ritual to Roman history and Greek mythology. Among the stories Ovid tells at length are those of Arion and the dolphin, the rape of Lucretia, the shield that fell from heaven, the adventures of Dido's sister, the Great Mother's journey to Rome, the killing of Remus, the bloodsucking birds, and the murderous daughter of King Servius. The poem also relates a wealth of customs and beliefs, such as the unluckiness of marrying in May.This lively new edition by Anne and Peter Wiseman is the only modern prose translation of Ovid's Fasti and also the most accurate.

The reiterated yet endlessly transfigured elements in this landscape--Persephone, a copper beech, a mother and father and sister, a garden, a husband and son, a horse, a dog, a field on fire, a mountain--persistently emerge and reappear with the dark energy of the inevitable, shot through with the bright aspect of things new-made.From the outset (Come here / Come here, little one), Gluck's voice has addressed us with deceptive simplicity, the poems in lines so clear we do not see the intervening fathoms.From within the earth'sbitter disgrace, coldness and barrennessmy friend the moon rises: she is beautiful tonight, but when is she not beautiful?To read these books together is to understand the governing paradox of a life lived in the body and of the work wrested from it, the one fated to die and the other to endure.;Louise Gluck;634;2013;Poems 1962-2012;poetry

With hair teased to Jesus, mile-long false eyelashes, and a white Cadillac Eldorado with atomic-red leather seats, Fanny is not your typical granny rocking in a chair. Instead, think of a character that looks a lot like Eva Gabor in Green Acres, but darkened with a shadow of Flannery O'Connor. A cross-genre collection that reads like a novel, this book is both a collection of oral history and a lyrical and moving biography that wrestles with the complexities of the South, including poverty, racism, and domestic violence.;Nickole Brown;136;2015;Fanny Says;poetry
692437428;eng;4,31;In Weinberg's debut thriller, a California lawyer defends a psychiatrist after someone stabs one of the doctor's Vietnam veteran patients. Dr. David Samson, who works at a Department of Veterans Affairs psychiatric compound in Hawaii, is in desperate need of legal assistance. A murdered vet lands Samson in trouble when cops believe that high doses of antidepressants were the reason for the killer's violence. Based on a recommendation, Samson seeks help from California public defender Noah Shane. The doctor already suspects a coverup: he thinks that unknown persons, possibly from the military or the VA, are trying to stop his experimental drug tests.... Samson's suspicions seem to be justified when there's another murder before his trial can even begin as well as a few kidnappings. This legal thriller concentrates mainly on the thriller aspects, as Noah is rarely inside a courtroom. In fact, he spends most of his time in the later part of the novel taking part in a pseudo-court-martial held by vengeful, crazed vets. Noah's life in general is filled with tension and suspense, which Weinberg dishes out with panache. He reveals, for example, that there's another significant reason why Samson hand-picked Noah as his attorney--one that the psychiatrist doesn't divulge for quite some time. Noah also seems to have genuine feelings for a trio of women: law school pal Kate Waverly, ex-prostitute/junkie Lisa Sanders, and Hawaiian attorney Stephanie Kauna-Luke.... An often exhilarating novel--Kirkus ReviewsPublic Defender Noah Shane receives a mysterious package from Veterans Affairs psychiatrist Dr. David Samson, who ministers to 28 exceedingly violent Vietnam veterans at a hospital compound in the remote jungle of the Big Island of Hawaii. Using unorthodox treatment, the doctor has recently achieved a breakthrough but, when one vet kills another, he is charged with complicity in the murder, and asks Noah to defend him. Though puzzled about this jungle doctor selecting an ordinary public defender as his defense lawyer, Noah decides that a brief adventure might help ease a growing case of PD burnout. He has no way of knowing that this foray will turn out to be much more. Investigation discloses that the charges have been manufactured by Dr. Samson's superior, who masterminded a plot to cover up unspeakable biological experiments with support from shadowy figures as far up the chain of ,nd as the Pentagon. As the criminal case against Dr. Samson unfolds simultaneously with a makeshift court-martial at the isolated Heart of Darkness jungle compound, the sinister project that has been hidden with these forsaken bush vets for 40 years is revealed. Staggered by shocking discoveries about his history in the course of the proceedings, Noah struggles with the strength of his own character as it is profoundly challenged in the explosive climax.In his outstanding debut novel, Ivan Weinberg serves up a legal thriller unlike any I've ever read before. He combines his intricate knowledge of the law, gained from over 30 years practicing at the bar, with a thrilling look at combat-stressed veterans living in self-imposed exile on the lush island of Hawaii. Ivan gives us a rare blend of action and legal intrigue in this courtroom drama about a bizarre military experiment gone horribly wrong. It will stick with you long after you've turned the last page.-- STEPHEN J.

These poems of maturation chronicle the poet's relationship with his immigrant family and his unknowing attempt to recapture the unity of youth through comically doomed love affairs that evaporate before they start. Hungrily eclectic, the wry and emotionally piercing poems in this collection steal the forms of the shooting script, blues song, novel, memoir, essay, logical disputation, aphorism--even classical Chinese poetry in translation. But as contest judge Louise Gluck notes in her foreword, The miracle of this book is the degree to which Ken Chen manages to be both exhilaratingly modern (anti-catharsis, anti-epiphany) while at the same time never losing his attachment to voice, and the implicit claims of voice: these are poems of intense feeling. . . .

The Plum in Mr. Blum's Pudding was penned while both rapt and lost by this transition. Gracefully toiling between the quirky and earnest, these poems describe the liminal space of the foreigner caught between the strange and the familiar. The result is surreal and unclassifiable, a book of love poems overshadowed by isolation and underscored with curiosity and lust.Originally published in 1990 by Cole Swift & Sons (Japan) as a small hardcover edition of two hundred copies, this new edition acts to preserve this work and features an introduction by art critic and curator Kristine McKenna, an afterward by Tosh Berman, and additional content by Ruth Bernstein.;Tosh Berman;112;2014;The Plum in Mr. Blum's Pudding;poetry

He intensified his study of Chinese and Japanese, and taking up the challenge of one of his professors, Chen Shih-hsiang, he began to work on translating a largely unknown poet by the name of Han Shan, a writer with whom the professor thought Snyder might feel a special affinity. The results were magical. As Patrick Murphy noted, These poems are something more than translations precisely because Snyder renders them as a melding of Han Shan's Chinese Ch'an Buddhist mountain spirit trickster mentality and Snyder's own mountain wilderness meditation and labor activities. The suite of 24 poems was published in the 1958 issue of The Evergreen Review, and the career of one of America's greatest poets was launched.In 1972, Press-22 issued a beautiful edition of these poems written out by hand in italic by Michael McPherson. We are doing a new augments edition based on the old, with a new design, a preface by Lu Ch'iu-yin, and an afterword by Mr. Snyder where he discusses how he came to this work and what it meant to his development as a writer and Buddhist.On May 11, 2012, for the Stronach Memorial Lecture at The University of California, more than fifty years after his days there as a student, Snyder offered a public lecture reflecting on Chinese poetry, Han Shan, and his continuing work as a poet and translator.

Togetherness changes everything, impossibly so.Simultaneously playful and poignant with tons of linguistic precision, the emotional urgency that informs Matt Hart's writing in RADIANT COMPANION raises the stakes for the reader--he is just that good.

674504968;eng;4,08;Arjuna and the Hunter is one of the great court epics of the Sanskrit literary canon. Written by the sixth-century poet Bharavi, it is also the first and most remarkable reinterpretation of a pivotal episode in the Mahabharata, India's ancient epic. The warrior Arjuna travels to the Himalayas to perform penance and win a boon from the god Shiva that will help his brothers, the Pandavas, overcome their enemies in righteous war. Appearing in the guise of a hunter, Shiva tests Arjuna s courage in combat, ultimately reveals himself, and bestows upon the hero an invincible weapon.In Bharavi's hands, the episode is turned into a masterful contemplation of heroic action, ethical conduct, ascetic discipline, and religious devotion core values in India's classical civilization and enduring themes in Indian literature. But the poem's fame rests above all on its aesthetic achievement. With its elegant, epigrammatic verse, powerful imagery, dramatic speeches, and vivid descriptions, Arjuna and the Hunter, now made available for the first time in a complete English translation will dazzle and move contemporary readers no less powerfully than its first courtly connoisseurs.;Bharavi, Indira Viswanathan Peterson;480;2016;Arjuna and the Hunter;poetry

Goring's passion for Colombia and its people, at times reminiscent of Lorca, engulfs the reader in unbearably beautiful images of pain and injustice:My love in the dead groves, beyondthe murderous palms: I wanted youwithout poison, I wanted you starrywith milk and pendulous leaves.This book is itself a dream tree / pungent of everything.--Helen Degen Cohen;Ruth Goring;116;2015;Soap Is Political;poetry
984005129;eng;4,84;A Poet's Journey: Emotions, is a veritable roller coaster of emotions from heights of joy to the depths of despair. The good, the bad, and the beautiful of being human, a work set to the huge dichotomy called life. A POET'S JOURNEY: EMOTION is full of honest human emotion expressed through beautiful rhythmic poetry. This vast collection is perfectly tuned by talented author, Marta Moran Bishop. Her work will leave you laughing, crying, and remembering. From subtle romance in MOONLIT NIGHTS to cries of nature in THE YETI SCREAMS IN PURE DELIGHT, and the ravaging pain of experiencing a loved one's terminal battle in BETRAYAL. This is powerful poetry for all. Sammy Sutton, author of King Solomon's Journey. Ms. Bishop states that most of the poems tell a story of something that happened. Some are built upon a thought or a line that wouldn't leave her. She believes poetry should make the reader feel and connect with the emotion and the story. This unique collection brings together works as diverse and influential as The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Maya Angelou, and Robert Frost.;Marta Moran Bishop;100;2012;A Poet's Journey: Emotions;poetry
310761832;eng;4,03;When the heart gets lost, let the music find you.Blade never asked for a life of the rich and famous. In fact, he'd give anything not to be the son of Rutherford Morrison, a washed-up rock star and drug addict with delusions of a comeback. Or to no longer be part of a family known most for lost potential, failure, and tragedy. The one true light is his girlfriend, Chapel, but her parents have forbidden their relationship, assuming--like many--that Blade will become just like his father.In reality, the only thing Blade has in common with Rutherford is the music that lives inside them. But not even the songs that flow through Blade's soul are enough when he's faced with two unimaginable realities: the threat of losing Chapel forever, and the revelation of a long-held family secret, one that leaves him questioning everything he thought was true. All that remains is a letter and a ticket to Ghana--both of which could bring Blade the freedom and love he's been searching for, or leave him feeling even more adrift.;Kwame Alexander, Mary Rand Hess;464;2017;Solo;poetry

He was in his late forties when he committed himself to writing an ode a week and in the end produced a total of 225, which are dispersed throughout his varied oeuvre. This bilingual volume, edited by Ilan Stavans, a distinguished translator and scholar of Latin American literature, gathers all the odes together for the first time in any language. Rendered into English by an assortment of accomplished translators that include Philip Levine, Paul Muldoon, Mark Strand, and Margaret Sayers Peden, collectively they read like the personal diary of a man in search of meaning, who sings to life itself, to our connection to one another, and to the place we have in nature and the cosmos. The odes are also a lasting statement on the role of poetry as a lighting-rod during tumultuous times.;Pablo Neruda, Ilan Stavans;896;2013;All the Odes;poetry

Some of these encounters are slights, seeming slips of the tongue, and some are intentional offensives in the classroom, at the supermarket, at home, on the tennis court with Serena Williams and the soccer field with Zinedine Zidane, online, on TV-everywhere, all the time. The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive. Our addressability is tied to the state of our belonging, Rankine argues, as are our assumptions and expectations of citizenship. In essay, image, and poetry, Citizenis a powerful testament to the individual and collective effects of racism in our contemporary, often named post-race society.;Claudia Rankine;169;2014;Citizen: An American Lyric;poetry

9780819573;eng;4,56;Like an underground river, the astonishing poems of Joseph Ceravolo have nurtured American poetry for fifty years, a presence deeply felt but largely invisible. Collected Poems offers the first full portrait of Ceravolo's aesthetic trajectory, bringing to light the highly original voice that was operating at an increasing remove from the currents of the time. From a poetics associated with Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery to an ever more contemplative, deeply visionary poetics similar in sensibility to Zen and Dante, William Blake and St. John of the Cross, this collection shows how Ceravolo's poetry takes on a direct, quiet lyricism: intensely dedicated to the natural and spiritual life of the individual. As Ron Silliman notes, Ceravolo's later work reveals him to be one of the most emotionally open, vulnerable and self-knowing poets of his generation. Many new pieces, including the masterful long poem The Hellgate, are published here for the first time. This volume is a landmark edition for American poetry, and includes an introduction by David Lehman.-Wesleyan University Press;Joseph Ceravolo;500;2013;Collected Poems;poetry

And what does 'native' mean if the English oak is an immigrant from Spain?In ninety richly varied poems and illuminating prose interludes, Ruth Padel's original new book weaves science, myth, wild nature and human history to conjure a world created and sustained by migration.'We're all from somewhere else,' she begins, tracing the millennia-old journeys of cells, trees, birds and beasts. Geese battle raging winds over Mount Everest, lemurs skim precipices in Madagascar and wildebeest, at the climax of their epic trek from Tanzania, brave a river filled with the largest, hungriest crocodiles in Africa.Human migration has shaped civilisation but today is one of the greatest challenges the world faces. In a series of incisive portraits, Padel turns to the struggles of human displacement - the Flight into Egypt, John James Audubon emigrating to America (feeding migrant birds en route), migrant workers in Mumbai and refugees labouring over a drastically changing planet - to show how the purpose of migration, for both humans and animals, is survival.Poignant, thought-provoking and utterly compelling, here is a magnificent tapestry of life on the move from the acclaimed author of Darwin: A Life in Poems.;Ruth Padel;254;2012;The Mara Crossing;poetry

It also means Uncle Arthur should be here to tell his stories, with a twinkle in his eye as he spins tales about how he came to have a missing finger. But this is the first year without Aunt Lucy, and when Uncle Arthur arrives, there's no twinkle to be found and no stories waiting to be told. Faith is certain, though, that with a little love and patience, she and Peter might finally learn the truth about that missing finger.

62343092;eng;4,25;An impassioned call for a return to reading poetry and an incisive argument for poetry's accessibility to all readers, by critically acclaimed poet Matthew ZapruderIn Why Poetry, award-winning poet Matthew Zapruder takes on what it is that poetry--and poetry alone--can do. Zapruder argues that the way we have been taught to read poetry is the very thing that prevents us from enjoying it. In lively, lilting prose, he shows us how that misunderstanding interferes with our direct experience of poetry and creates the sense of confusion or inadequacy that many of us feel when faced with it.Zapruder explores what poems are, and how we can read them, so that we can, as Whitman wrote, possess the origin of all poems, without the aid of any teacher or expert. Most important, he asks how reading poetry can help us to lead our lives with greater meaning and purpose.Anchored in poetic analysis and steered through Zapruder's personal experience of coming to the form, Why Poetry is engaging and conversational, even as it makes a passionate argument for the necessity of poetry in an age when information is constantly being mistaken for knowledge. While he provides a simple reading method for approaching poems and illuminates concepts like associative movement, metaphor, and negative capability, Zapruder explicitly confronts the obstacles that readers face when they encounter poetry to show us that poetry can be read, and enjoyed, by anyone.;Matthew Zapruder;256;2017;Why Poetry;poetry

085742324X;eng;4,44;One of the foremost poets of the French Resistance, Rene Char has been hailed by Donald Revell as the conscience of modern French poetry. Translated by Mark Hutchinson, The Inventorsis a companion volume to Char's critically acclaimed Hypnos. It gathers more than forty poems that represent a cross-section of Char's mature work, spanning from 1936 to 1988. All three genres of Char's work are represented here: verse poems, prose poems, and the abrupt, lapidary propositions for which he is best known. These maxima sententiacombine the terseness of La Rochefoucauld with the probing and sometimes riddling character of the fragments of Heraclitus.The Inventorsincludes a brief introduction to Char's life and work, as well as a series of notes on the backstories of the works, which explain allusions that may not be immediately familiar to the English-speaking reader. These new translations stay true to the originals, while at the same time conveying much of the music and beauty of the French poems.Praise for Rene CharChar, I believe, is a poet who will tower over twentieth-century French poetry.--George Steiner;Rene Char, Mark Hutchinson;112;2015;The Inventors: And Other Poems;poetry

It is an extraordinary meditation on a frozen oblivion, a place where God must be found under the ice, a place of beauty, danger, and transcendence. Contest judge, Teresa Leo, had this to say about it: Susan Allspaw's debut collection draws on her work and many trips to Antarctica in luminous poems that sweep panoramically across mesmerizing landscapes while meditating on the human condition through deep and reverent encounters with the natural world. Here is a reflective place where internal and external landscapes intertwine, making it impossible to avoid 'the mirror of the plateau that shows everyone's true face.' LITTLE OBLIVION's Antarctica is a liminal space that resides in between extremes, a place saturated with such whiteness that 'the sky bleeds into the earth / so that a whole body becomes a palindrome.' These exquisitely textured poems capture the essence of Antarctica's stark beauty. 'White will follow me everywhere, ' says the speaker in one of the poems.

1590309820;eng;4,4;Ryokan (1758-1831) is, along with Dogen and Hakuin, one of the three giants of Zen in Japan. But unlike his two renowned colleagues, Ryokan was a societal dropout, living mostly as a hermit and a beggar. He was never head of a monastery or temple. He liked playing with children. He had no dharma heir. Even so, people recognized the depth of his realization, and he was sought out by people of all walks of life for the teaching to be experienced in just being around him. His poetry and art were wildly popular even in his lifetime. He is now regarded as one of the greatest poets of the Edo Period, along with Basho, Buson, and Issa. He was also a master artist-calligrapher with a very distinctive style, due mostly to his unique and irrepressible spirit, but also because he was so poor he didn't usually have materials: his distinctive thin line was due to the fact that he often used twigs rather than the brushes he couldn't afford. He was said to practice his brushwork with his fingers in the air when he didn't have any paper. There are hilarious stories about how people tried to trick him into doing art for them, and about how he frustrated their attempts. As an old man, he fell in love with a young Zen nun who also became his student. His affection for her colors the mature poems of his late period. This collection contains more than 140 of Ryokan's poems, with selections of his art, and of the very funny anecdotes about him.;Ryokan, Kazuaki Tanahashi;224;2012;Sky Above, Great Wind: The Life and Poetry of Zen Master Ryokan;poetry

Separate chapter introductions outline the drama as it unfolds. The translation . . . is smooth, eloquent, and reliable . . .

It enjoys the highest esteem among the Hindu people, and is constantly quoted there as a great authority regarding doctrine. Its philosophy embodies the prevailing Hindu beliefs, as expounded by the Brahmans, and in its teachings it subtly blends into a harmonious whole the varying points of doctrine of Patanjali, Kapila and of the Vedas. It is supposed to have been written by Vyasa whose personality is veiled in doubt for of the time of his existence in the world no record seems to have been kept.To the reader who finds in this marvelous dialogue merely the record of a literal conversation dressed up in fancy by the Oriental imagination, the real beauty and purpose of the teaching is lost.;Anonymous, Ramananda Prasad;329;2015;Bhagavad-Gita;poetry

The field of my life becomes a boundless plain... -ThoreauVolume IX of the Hobblebush Granite State Poetry Series.If sound became visible, what shapes would it take? What images would flash before our eyes? And if those images were set once more to music, could we sing them with all our senses?Prompted by Thoreau's thought-experiment, Field Guide A Tempo is a topographical map of sounds, a landscape that changes pace, from ballad to dirge to lullaby, tracing the contours of those rhythms that give form and voice to Time itself.In music, the phrase a tempo directs the musician to play once again at an original speed. But what is our original speed, or are there more than one? This field guide, unlike all scientific manuals before it, sets life going at the changing rhythms of ancient myth, natural wonder, and human love, and lets us sing them: Consigned to no one but time, but to continuous / Tempos, their racings, my racings, their easing, mine.Henry Walters' poems are exuberantly 'out of bounds' and 'in accord,' inventing new edges for their passions in a wild sophistication of verse forms and private mythologies. Unafraid of ecstasy, this poet has stolen Hermes' tortoise-lyre and on it he plays tunes at once ancient and violently new. Every line ignites. --Rosanna WarrenSometimes we need a guide to show us the way in which we're lost. Sometimes we need a field guide to reintroduce us to the manifold wonder of the world that too often comes to us as the already known, the easily recognized. Henry Walters is such a guide, and he has written us a guidebook. But poems are curious documents of existence. They establish the world before they find out its facts. Unlike those guides whose index shows you the flora and fauna of a given biome, a poetic field guide comes fraught with the knowledge that so little of what's real can ever be wholly conveyed--save, perhaps, by letting definition drift into pure song. But what song can keep singing itself at the pitch of pure existence? None can. Nor should it. Rather, we need poems such as Walters writes, poems that show the relict ancient world persists in this current one, and that we suffer a need we seldom feel, to describe not only ourselves back to ourselves--field guide to the intimate geography of being human--but to find within the deep descriptive effort that music that undergirds the daily whole.--Dan Beachy-Quick;Henry Walters;104;2014;Field Guide A Tempo;poetry

The poem is modelled on the genre of the Breton lay popular in Middle English literature of the 12th century, and it explores the conflict of heroic or chivalric values and Christianity, and their relation to the institution of marriage.A major source for the poem has been identified as the Breton song 'Le Seigneur Nann et la Fee', which Tolkien probably knew through Wimberly's Folklore in the English and Scottish Ballads (1928).;J.R.R.

Virk was an Asian adolescent whose drowned body was found in the Gorge Waterway in a Victoria, BC suburb, in 1997. Some of the poems use found material from court transcripts. The murder made international headlines due to the viciousness employed by Virk's assailants: seven girls and one boy between the ages of 13 and 16, five of whom were white. The poems examine in part the poet's remembrances of girlhood, the unease of adolescence, and the circumstances that enable some to pass through unhurt.;Soraya Peerbaye, Beth Follett;100;2015;Tell: poems for a girlhood;poetry
996316744;eng;4,36;* Winner of the 2015 Essay Collection Competition, Selected by Wayne Koestenbaum *Rarely have I come across tenderness, venom, and fire held so intimately, so exquisitely, as in Lily Hoang's A Bestiary. This book would be impressive enough as a collection of finely-forged fragments, but as it weaves itself into an even more impressive whole, my hat came off. Lily Hoang writes like she has nothing to lose and everything at stake. --Maggie NelsonA Bestiary is a work of great subtlety, precision, intelligence, daring, and emotive keenness. It seems completely contemporary (by which I mean that it is unlike anything I've read and that it makes me want to change my own writerly procedures). With head!long, reckless, improvisatory gestures, Lily Hoang prompts us to rethink what literature today can dare to aspire to. Her intellectually magnanimous book's position on the threshold between recognizable 'literature' and some other vanguard form of performance/utterance made me feel happy and stimulated and dizzy (in a rapturous way) while I was reading it. --Wayne KoestenbaumThe most perfect use of fragmentation, myth, language, fairytale, and terrible beauty that I have ever seen in my life. I'm swooning. My faith in what writing can be has been restored. --Lidia YuknavitchLily Hoang is the author of four books, including Changing, recipient of a PEN Open Books Award. She has two novels forthcoming: Old Cat Lady and The Book of Martha and she co-edited the anthology The Force of What's Possible: Writers on Accessibility and the Avant-Garde.
